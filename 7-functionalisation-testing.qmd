2.5 $\mu$m x 2.5 $\mu$m atomic force microscope images of a surfactant-deposited carbon nanotube film before and after exposure to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and after exposure to DMSO containing 1 mM 1-pyrenebutanoic acid n-hydroxysuccinimide ester (PBASE).

To accurately characterise devices with atomic force microscopy before and after functionalisation, it was important to first understand the impact that the non-biological elements used in a functionalisation process have on imaging the carbon nanotube film.
