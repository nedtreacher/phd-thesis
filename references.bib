abstract = {Aptameric graphene-based field-effect transistors (A-GFETs) always employ linkers, which could immobilize on graphene through {\"{I}}-$\pi$stacking between contained pyrenyl groups and graphene, to anchor aptamers. Aptamer density is closely associated with the A-GFET sensitivity and determined by the linker density. Using known linker immobilization methods, the linker density is random, uncontrollable, and limited. In this work, we propose a novel linker immobilization method which can be used to effectively modulate the linker density using an electric field and further bridge the relationship between the linker density and the A-GFET sensitivity. Here, polar molecule 1-pyrenebutanoic acid succinimidyl ester (PASE) is used as a linker representative. In the electric field, PASE is arranged regularly with the electron-rich pyrenyl group forced toward graphene in the solution due to electrostatic repulsion, thereby making it possible to modulate the quantity of PASE molecules that could interact with graphene by tuning the electric field application and then realizing the regulation of the A-GFET sensitivity. Experimental results indicate that the limits of detection (LODs) of A-GFETs for detecting interleukin-6 (IL-6) and insulin can be significantly improved to be 618 and 766 fM, respectively, by applying an electric field at-0.3 V for 3 h during PASE immobilization.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the effect of negative gate bias stress with different times on the Carbon Nanotube Field Effect Transistor (CNTFET) based gas sensors, obtained using Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (SWCNTs) mats as channel. The effects of Gate Bias Stress (GBS) on transistor performance are important; hence it is necessary to understand how our device behaves under bias stress. To perform this work, I-V characteristics, are taken by applying a constant gate voltage (Vgs) for an extended time. I-V characteristics after stress exhibited an identical shape to the one before stress with an important degradation of the current that flows through the transistors. A possible source of the Bias Stress Effect (BSE) is traps in the semiconductor itself which are spatially and energetically isolated due to the disorder of SWCNTs. This hypothesis will be confirmed by the saturation of the drain current shift ∆I after a prolonged period of time. All isolated trap states are saturated and only electrical traps still active and give us the original I-V characteristics.},

Here, we report bias ranges under which CNT transistors can operate continuously for months or more without degradation. Using a custom characterization system, the impacts of defect formation and charge traps on the stability of CNT-based sensors under extended bias are determined. In addition to breakdown, which is well-known, we identify three additional operational modes: full stability, slow decay, and fast decay. We identify a current drift behavior that reduces dynamic range by over four orders of magnitude but is avoidable with appropriate sensing modalities. Identification of these stable operation modes and limits for nanotube-based sensors addresses concerns surrounding their development for a myriad of sensing applications.},

The origin of this variability is elucidated by employing a top-coated, hydrophobic monolayer to passivate bottom-gated devices.

The effect of gate and drain-source bias on hysteresis is considered, showing strong dependence that must be accounted for when analyzing the effectiveness of a passivation layer.

The heterostructure was contacted from the top with gold leads on two sides, and the device's properties including intrinsic charge carrier density, mobility, and contact resistance were studied as a function of temperature from 4 K to 270 K. We show that the contact resistance of the device mainly originates from the metal/graphene interface, which contributes a significant part to the total resistance. We demonstrate that current annealing affects the graphene/metal interface significantly, whereas the intrinsic carrier density and carrier mobility of the hBN-encapsulated few-layer graphene are almost unaffected, contrary to often reported mobility improvements. However, after current annealing, a 75\% reduction in the contact resistance improves the overall performance of such a heterostructure device and the backgate-dependent transfer curve becomes more symmetric with respect to the Dirac point. A maximum carrier mobility of 11 200 cm 2 V - 1 s - 1 for this hBN/graphene/hBN heterostructure was measured at 4 K, showing good device performance, in particular, after current annealing.},

However, the lack of the effective means to distinguish the electrical properties of graphene at the contact and channel regions limits a clear understanding of their contributions to the Dirac point(s). A method, which can characterize the electrical properties of graphene under metal contact and in the channel, is developed, respectively. It is found that the Fermi levels of graphene at the contact and channel regions are quite different in the GFETs. The difference in Fermi levels results in the penetration of the doping effect under the contact into the channel with a length as long as 1 µm. The difference also causes the double Dirac point feature in the long-channel GFET due to the combined graphene properties both in contact and channel. One of the two Dirac points diminished in short-channel GFET due to the penetration of doping effect under the contact. The study demonstrates that the electrical behavior of short-channel GFET is dominated by the contact region. This paces a way to deeply understand and further improve the performances of GFETs by controlling the Fermi levels in the whole devices.},

abstract = {Graphene is considered to be a promising candidate for future nanoelectronics due to its exceptional electronic properties. Unfortunately, the graphene field-effect transistors (PETs) cannot be turned off effectively due to the absence of a band gap. leading to an on/off current ratio typically around 5 in top-gated graphene FETs. On the other hand, theoretical investigations and optical measurements suggest that a band gap up to a few hundred millielectronvolts can be created by the perpendicular E-field in bilayer graphenes. Although previous carrier transport measurements in bilayer graphene transistors did indicate a gate-induced Insulating state at temperatures below 1 K, the electrical (or transport) band gap was estimated to be a few millielectronvolts, and the room temperature on/off current ratio in bilayer graphene FETs remains similar to those in single-layer graphene FETs. Here, for the first time, we report an on/off current ratio of around 100 and 2000 at room temperature and 20 K, respectively, in our dual-gate bilayer graphene FETs. We also measured an electrical band gap of > 130 and 80 meV at average electric displacements of 2.2 and 1.3 V nm-1, respectively. This demonstration reveals the great potential of bilayer graphene in applications such as digital electronics, pseudospintronics, terahertz technology, and infrared nanophotonics. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Field-effect transistors based on single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and graphene can function as highly sensitive nanoscale (bio)sensors in solution. Here, we compare experimentally how SWNT and graphene transistors respond to changes in the composition of the aqueous electrolyte in which they are immersed. We show that the conductance of SWNTs and graphene is strongly affected by changes in the ionic strength, the pH, and the type of ions present, in a manner that can be qualitatively different for graphene and SWNT devices. We show that this sensitivity to electrolyte composition results from a combination of different mechanisms including electrostatic gating, Schottky-barrier modifications, and changes in gate capacitance. Interestingly, we find strong evidence that the sensor response to changes in electrolyte composition is affected by a high density of ionizable groups on both the underlying substrate and the carbon surfaces. We present a model based on the (regulated) surface charge associated with these ionizable groups that explains the majority of our data. Our findings have significant implications for interpreting and optimizing sensing experiments with nanocarbon transistors.

abstract = {We have studied gate hysteresis of carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNFETs) on silicon oxide substrates in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) at low temperatures. It is found that the hysteresis is neither reduced by thermal annealing at temperatures over 300°C under UHV nor significantly affected by independent adsorption of ammonia or water at T = 56 K. However, the hysteresis decreases greatly upon coadsorption of water and ammonia below condensation temperatures and restores completely with desorption of the adsorbed water layer. On the basis of these results, it is concluded that the main cause of gate hysteresis in CNFETs on silicon oxide substrate is charge transfer between the carbon nanotube and charge traps at the silicon oxide/ ambient interface. We propose a mechanism for gate hysteresis that involves surface silanol groups as the major sources of screening charges. This surface silanol model is supported by results from scanning surface potential microscopy (SSPM). {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

@article{Kim2003,
abstract = {Carbon nanotube field-effect transistors commonly comprise nanotubes lying on SiO 2 surfaces exposed to the ambient environment. It is shown here that the transistors exhibit hysteresis in their electrical characteristics because of charge trapping by water molecules around the nanotubes, including SiO 2 surface-bound water proximal to the nanotubes. Hysteresis persists for the transistors in vacuum since the SiO 2-bound water does not completely desorb in vacuum at room temperature, a known phenomenon in SiO 2 surface chemistry. Heating under dry conditions significantly removes water and reduces hysteresis in the transistors. Nearly hysteresis-free transistors are obtainable by passivating the devices with polymers that hydrogen bond with silanol groups on SiO 2 (e.g., with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)). However, nanotube humidity sensors could be explored with suitable water-sensitive coatings. The results may have implications to field-effect transistors made from other chemically derived materials. The interaction between single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and molecular species in the environment can significantly affect the electrical properties of nanotube devices. 1 This effect can be exploited for nanoscale chemical sensors, 2,3 but is not desired for nanotube-based field-effect transistors (FETs) 4-13 potentially applied to future electronics. Passivation of these transistors should be developed to impart stable electrical characteristics against environmental changes. Hysteresis due to various charge traps in a FET must be eliminated for most applications or must be controlled for specific memory devices. Recently, several groups reported SWNT FETs fabricated on SiO 2 /Si substrates (device structure similar to that in Figure 1a) exhibiting hysteresis in current versus gate-voltage (Si as back-gate) characteristics and attributed the hysteresis to charge traps in bulk SiO 2 , oxygen-related defect trap sites near nanotubes, or traps at the SiO 2 /Si interface. 11,12,14 No dependence of the hysteresis on chemical environments was observed (e.g., in ambient air versus in vacuum). Here, we show that the foremost significant cause of hysteresis in passivation-free nanotube FETs is the water molecule, especially SiO 2 surface-bound water that cannot be fully removed by pumping in vacuum. We also report that a simple polymer coating can be used as passivation to afford nearly hysteresis-free nanotube transistors. The nanotube FETs used in this work were obtained by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) synthesis 15 of individual semiconducting SWNTs to bridge preformed molyb-denum source (S) and drain (D) electrodes (Figure 1b) 16 or. † Authors with equal contributions.

We discuss that, despite the fact that the charge transfer between the nanotube and O2 adsorbator has not been agreed to date, the effect of oxygen adsorption should still be interpreted as inducing p-type doping in the nanotube body. The n-type doping by NH3 adsorption is also measured for the purpose of comparison.

abstract = {Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have great potential for use in electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, methods for synthesizing SWCNTs produce a mixture of metallic and semiconducting materials, which require additional processing to separate by electronic type. Purification and enrichment of the semiconducting fraction is readily achieved by using the centrifugation of aqueous suspensions of SWCNTs with the help of surfactants, but this leaves residual surfactant on the SWCNT surface that can impact their electronic and optical properties. Here, we present a detailed study of the sodium taurodeoxycholate (STDC) surfactant removal process during vacuum annealing, showing that it occurs through fragmentation of the surfactant, and that complete removal requires exceedingly high temperatures, which indicates strong binding to the SWCNTs. We then present an approach based on air oxidation and mild annealing to completely remove the surfactant while maintaining the SWCNT properties. Using this approach, we compare single SWCNT electronic devices with and without STDC and show that, despite the very strong surfactant binding, it does not affect device performance substantially. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Chemical Society.},

Here we demonstrate that the sensitivity of NW-FET sensors can be exponentially enhanced in the subthreshold regime where the gating effect of molecules bound on a surface is the most effective due to the reduced screening of carriers in NWs. This principle is exemplified in both pH and protein sensing experiments where the operational mode of NW-FET biosensors was tuned by electrolyte gating. The lowest charge detectable by NW-FET sensors working under different operational modes is also estimated. Our work shows that optimization of NW-FET structure and operating conditions can provide significant enhancement and fundamental understanding for the sensitivity limits of NW-FET sensors.},

abstract = {A CMOS-like inverter was integrated by using ambipolar carbon nanotube (CNT) transistors without doping. The ambipolar CNT transistors automatically configure themselves to play a role as an n-type or p-type transistor in a logic circuit depending on the supply voltage (V DD) and ground. A NOR (NAND) gate is adaptively converted to a NAND (NOR) gate. This adaptiveness of logic gates exhibiting two logic gate functions in a single logic circuit offers a new opportunity for designing logic circuits with high integration density for next generation applications. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) provide an opportunity to achieve extremely high intrinsic carrier mobility and high current carrying capacity. 1-6 However, several obstacles with their use have been encountered. Among them, ambipolarity in Schottky barrier carbon nanotube field effect transistors (CNT-FET) is a well-known phenomenon occurring under a vacuum environment or with a top gate oxide and top gate electrode. 7,8 CNT-based CMOS technology has been realized by suppressing one of the ambipolar regions of the CNTs with p-or n-type doping. 9-20 These approaches are limited to the conventional concept of silicon devices that utilize unipolar p-and n-type transistors in the realization of CMOS. Doping of CNTs with p-or n-type to remove ambipolarity is still challenging. Here, we report a different approach that considers ambipolarity not as a drawback but as a benefit in architecturing CNT-based CMOS circuits. CMOS-like logic circuits such as inverters and NOR/NAND gates were integrated by using ambipolar CNT transistors without the use of an unreliable doping process. The key idea in this work is that ambipolar CNT transistors automatically configure themselves to play the role as n-type or p-type transistors in logic circuits depending on the exchange of the supply voltage (V DD) and ground. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that by flipping the voltage of V DD and ground, a NOR (NAND) gate can be adaptively converted to a NAND (NOR) gate. This adaptiveness of logic gates exhibiting two logic gate functions by using one logic circuit has never been demonstrated. An array of thin film transistors (TFTs) was fabricated with randomly networked single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) that were synthesized selectively on a designed array of catalyst photoresists (0.01 M of ferrocene) 21 by using a remote plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) method at low temperature (450 °C). 22 The corresponding source and drain electrodes with Ti (5 nm)/ Au (50 nm) (channel length, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10 µm; width, 40 µm; 20 channels for each length in a sample) were deposited to form an array of 200 TFTs. A conformal thin film of a top gate oxide (Al 2 O 3 , 50 nm) was deposited by an atomic layer deposition technique at 150 °C. The gate electrode (Ti (5 nm)/Au (50 nm)) was formed similarly to the source and drain electrodes. The detailed method has been described elsewhere. 21,22 Logic circuits were fabricated by connecting several TFTs with gold wire with wire bonder. I-V characteristics of the CNT-TFTs were measured under ambient conditions by a source-measure unit (Keithley 236, 237) using a probe station.

abstract = {Carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNFETs) are a promising nanotechnology for the development of energy-efficient computing. Despite rapid progress, CNFETs have only been fabricated in academic or research laboratories. A critical challenge in transferring this technology to commercial manufacturing facilities is developing a suitable method for depositing nanotubes uniformly over industry-standard large-area substrates. Such a deposition method needs to be manufacturable, compatible with today's silicon-based technologies, and provide a path to achieving systems with energy efficiency benefits over silicon. Here, we show that a deposition technique in which the substrate is submerged within a nanotube solution can address these challenges and can allow CNFETs to be fabricated within industrial facilities. By elucidating the mechanisms driving nanotube deposition, we develop process modifications to standard solution-based methods that significantly improve throughput, accelerating the deposition process by more than 1,100 times, while simultaneously reducing cost. This allows us to fabricate CNFETs in a commercial silicon manufacturing facility and high-volume semiconductor foundry. We demonstrate uniform and reproducible CNFET fabrication across industry-standard 200 mm wafers, employing the same equipment currently being used to fabricate silicon product wafers. Using a solution-based deposition technique, carbon nanotube field-effect transistors can be fabricated in a commercial silicon manufacturing facility and a high-volume commercial foundry, demonstrating uniform and reproducible transistor fabrication across industry-standard 200 mm wafers.},

abstract = {Hypothesis: Soluble surfactants in evaporating sessile droplets can cause a circulatory Marangoni flow. However, it is not straightforward to predict for what cases this vortical flow arises. It is hypothesized that the occurrence of Marangoni circulation can be predicted from the values of a small number of dimensionless parameters. Simulations: A numerical model for the drop evolution is developed using lubrication theory. Surfactant transport is implemented by means of convection–diffusion-adsorption equations. Results are compared to literature. Findings: It is shown that stronger evaporation, slower adsorption kinetics and lower solubility of the surfactants all tend to increasingly suppress Marangoni circulation. These results are found to be consistent with both experimental and numerical results from literature and can explain qualitative differences in flow behavior of surfactant-laden droplets. Furthermore, diffusion also tends to counteract Marangoni flow, where bulk diffusion has a more significant influence than surface diffusion. Also, the formation of micelles is found to slightly suppress Marangoni circulation. Experimental results from literature, however, show that in some cases circulatory behavior is enhanced by micelles, possibly even resulting in qualitative changes in the flow. Potential explanations for these differences are given and extensions to the model are suggested to improve its consistency with experiments.},

abstract = {When a spilled drop of coffee dries on a solid surface, it leaves a dense, ring-like deposit along the perimeter (Fig. 1a). The coffee—initially dispersed over the entire drop—becomes concentrated into a tiny fraction of it. Such ring deposits are common wherever drops containing dispersed solids evaporate on a surface, and they influence processes such as printing, washing and coating1,2,3,4,5. Ring deposits also provide a potential means to write or deposit a fine pattern onto a surface. Here we ascribe the characteristic pattern of the deposition to a form of capillary flow in which pinning of the contact line of the drying drop ensures that liquid evaporating from the edge is replenished by liquid from the interior. The resulting outward flow can carry virtually all the dispersed material to the edge. This mechanism predicts a distinctive power-law growth of the ring mass with time—a law independent of the particular substrate, carrier fluid or deposited solids. We have verified this law by microscopic observations of colloidal fluids.},

The network morphologies were observed using atomic force microscopy, and the electronic transport properties of thin-film transistors composed of these materials were examined. The network morphologies were highly dependent on the surfactants, although the thin films were fabricated from the same nanotube using the same process. Among the four surfactants examined in this work, sodium deoxycholate produced the finest mesh structures that comprised mostly individual nanotubes. The performance of the thin-film transistor was highly correlated with the morphology of the nanotube network; however, no considerable effect of the residual surfactant was observed. Because of the fine mesh structure, both the highest on/off ratio (1 × 106) and the highest mobility (42 cm2 V-1 s-1) were obtained for the thin-film transistor produced from sodium deoxycholate. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

This phenomenon is of significant importance for a wide range of applications where monolayer graphene sheets are used with liquids, especially as an electrode material in electrochemical applications such as energy storage and conversion. Liquid-induced damage to SiO2-bound graphene was previously observed with a range of solvents. A recently developed microdroplet system, used for a detailed examination of this behaviour, reveals that fewlayer graphene flakes down to a bi-layer are stable with respect to aqueous electrolyte droplet formation, but the stability of these droplets is significantly reduced on monolayer graphene and irreversible rupture of the underlying graphene flake occurs. This damage, which we attribute to the presence of nanoscale defects and high adhesion between the graphene and the substrate, seems specific to plasma-cleaned SiO2 substrates and is not observed on flakes transferred to other substrates. Furthermore, the introduction of impurities, in the form of both polymer residues and native impurities between the flake and the SiO2 substrate, significantly enhance graphene's immunity to external strain as shown by optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy.},

abstract = {In this work, we identify two issues that can significantly affect the accuracy of AFM measurements of the diameter of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and propose a protocol that reduces errors associated with these issues. Measurements of the nanotube height under different applied forces demonstrate that even moderate forces significantly compress several different types of SWCNTs, leading to errors in measured diameters that must be minimized and/or corrected. Substrate and nanotube roughness also make major contributions to the uncertainty associated with the extraction of diameters from measured images. An analysis method has been developed that reduces the uncertainties associated with this extraction to <0.1 nm. This method is then applied to measure the diameter distribution of individual highly semiconducting enriched nanotubes in networks prepared from polyfluorene/SWCNT dispersions. Good agreement is obtained between diameter distributions for the same sample measured with two different commercial AFM instruments, indicating the reproducibility of the method. The reduced uncertainty in diameter measurements based on this method facilitates: (1) determination of the thickness of the polymer layer wrapping the nanotubes and (2) measurement of nanotube compression at tube–tube junctions within the network.},

However, these approaches are known to leave polymer residues on the graphene surface, which are difficult to remove completely. In addition, graphene growth and transfer processes can introduce defects into the graphene layer. Both defects and resist contamination can affect the homogeneity of graphene-based PoC sensors, leading to inconsistent device performance and unreliable sensing. Sensor reliability is also affected by the harsh chemical environments used for chemical functionalisation of graphene PoC sensors, which can degrade parts of the sensor device. Therefore, a reliable, wafer-scale method of passivation, which isolates the graphene from the rest of the device, protecting the less robust device features from any aggres-sive chemicals, must be devised. This work covers the application of molecular vapour deposition technology to create a dielectric passivation film that protects graphene-based biosensing devices from harsh chemicals. We utilise a previously reported “healing effect” of Al2 O3 on graphene to reduce photoresist residue from the graphene surface and reduce the prevalence of graphene defects to improve graphene device homogeneity. The improvement in device consistency allows for more reliable, homogeneous graphene devices, that can be fabricated at wafer-scale for sensing and biosensing applications.},

Thin films of Chromium, Titanium and Alumina were deposited on Silicon/Silicon dioxide (Si/SiO2) wafer by electron beam. We introduced Al2O3 as a new adhesion layer to test the behavior of the Pt film at higher temperature using a ceramic adhesion thin film. Electric behaviors were measured for different annealing temperatures to know the performance for Cr/Pt, Ti/Pt, and Al2O3/Pt metallic film in the gas sensor application.

abstract = {This paper explores the possibility of using arrays of metallic carbon nanotubes as sensors. Unlike their semiconducting counterparts, single-walled carbon nanotube arrays or networks that are dominated by metallic conduction pathways have not been investigated for their environmental sensitivity. In this work, we demonstrate transduction of molecular adsorption via charge transfer through predominantly metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes. Raman spectroscopy and electric field dependent transport confirm that signal transduction takes place through primarily large diameter metallic nanotubes. This unique signal transduction mechanism might have implications for novel sensors. The scaling of the signal with array impedance is well described using an irreversible binding model developed previously. The arrays have several advantages including a simple, two-electrode fabrication, rapid regeneration, and a responsivity that scales predictably and linearly with the number of adsorption sites. An array-assisted hydrolysis of reactive analytes is found to regenerate the nanotube surface from hydrolyzable species which include important organophosphate nerve agents. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Nowadays, there is a high demand for sensitive and selective real-time analytical methods suitable for a wide range of applications, from personalized telemedicine, drug discovery, food safety, and quality control, to defense, security, as well as environmental monitoring. Biosensors are analytical devices able to detect bio-chemical analytes (e.g., neurotransmitters, cancer biomarkers, bio-molecules, and ions), through the combination of a bio-recognition element and a bio-transduction device. The use of customized bio-recognition elements such as enzymes, antibodies, aptamers, and ion-selective membranes facilitates achieving high selectivity. Among the different bio-transduction devices currently available, electrolyte-gated field-effect transistors, in which the dielectric is represented by an ionic liquid buffer solution containing the targeted analyte, are gaining increasing attention. Indeed, these bio-transduction devices are characterized by superior electronic properties and intrinsic signal amplification that allow the detection of a wide range of bio-molecules with high sensitivity (down to pM concentration). A promising semiconducting material for bio-transduction devices is represented by carbon nanotubes, due to their unique electrical properties, nanosize, bio-compatibility, and their simple low-cost processability. This work provides a comprehensive and critical review of electrolyte-gated carbon nanotube field-effect transistor-based biosensors. First, an introduction to these bio-sensing devices is given. Next, the device configurations and operating principles are presented, and the most used materials and processes are reviewed with a particular focus on carbon nanotubes as the active material. Subsequently, different functionalization strategies reported in the literature, based on enzymes, antibodies, aptamers, and ion-selective membranes, are analyzed critically. Finally, present issues and challenges faced in the area are investigated, the conclusions are drawn, and a perspective outlook over the field of bio-sensing technologies, in general, is provided.},

abstract = {Interest in point-of-care diagnostics has led to increasing demand for the development of nanomaterial-based electronic biosensors such as biosensor field-effect transistors (BioFETs) due to their inherent simplicity, sensitivity, and scalability. The utility of BioFETs, which use electrical transduction to detect biological signals, is directly dependent upon their electrical stability in detection-relevant environments. However, BioFET device structures vary substantially, especially in electrode passivation modalities. Improper passivation of electronic components in ionic solutions can lead to excessive leakage currents and signal drift, thus presenting a hinderance to signal detectability. Here, we harness the sensitivity of nanomaterials to study the effects of various passivation strategies on the performance and stability of a biosensing platform based on aerosol-jet-printed carbon nanotube thin-film transistors. Specifically, nonpassivated devices were compared to devices passivated with photoresist (SU-8), dielectric (HfO2), or photoresist + dielectric (SU-8 followed by HfO2) and were evaluated primarily by initial performance metrics, large-scale device yield, and stability throughout long-duration cycling in phosphate buffered saline. We find that all three passivation conditions result in improved device performance compared to nonpassivated devices, with the photoresist + dielectric strategy providing the lowest average leakage current in solution ($\sim$ 2 nA). Notably, the photoresist + dielectric strategy also results in the greatest yield of BioFET devices meeting our selected performance criteria on a wafer scale ($\sim$ 90\%), the highest long-term stability in solution (>0.01\% change in on-current), and the best average on/off-current ratio ($\sim$ 104), hysteresis ($\sim$ 32 mV), and subthreshold swing ($\sim$ 192 mV/decade). This passivation schema has the potential to pave the path toward a truly high-yield, stable, and robust electrical biosensing platform.},

The aluminum oxide was produced by thermally oxidizing AlN at 800-1100 C under dry O 2 conditions. The AlN films were deposited by RF magnetron sputtering on p-type Si (100) sub-strates. Thermal oxidation produced Al 2 O 3 with a thickness and structure that depended on the process time and temperature. The MIS capacitors exhibited the charge regimes of accumulation, depletion, and inversion on the Si semiconductor surface. The best electrical properties were obtained when all of the AlN was fully oxidized to Al 2 O 3 with no residual AlN. The MIS flatband voltage was near 0 V, the net oxide trapped charge density, ox , was less than 10 11 cm 2 , and the interface trap density, , was less than 10 11 cm 2 eV 1. At an oxide electric field of 0.3 MV/cm, the leakage current density was less than 10 7 A cm 2 , with a resistivity greater than 10 12-cm. The critical field for dielectric breakdown ranged from 4 to 5 MV/cm. The temperature dependence of the current versus electric field indicated that the conduction mechanism was Frenkel-Poole emission, which has the interesting property that higher temperatures reduce the current. This may be important for the reliability of circuits operating under extreme conditions. The dielectric constant ranged from 3 to 9. The excellent electronic quality of aluminum oxide may be attractive for field effect transistor applications.},

abstract = {Carbon nanotube transistors have outstanding potential for electronic detection of biomolecules in solution. The physical mechanism underlying sensing however remains controversial, which hampers full exploitation of these promising nanosensors. Previously suggested mechanisms are electrostatic gating, changes in gate coupling, carrier mobility changes, and Schottky barrier effects. We argue that each mechanism has its characteristic effect on the liquid gate potential dependence of the device conductance. By studying both the electron and hole conduction, the sensing mechanisms can be unambiguously identified. From extensive protein-adsorption experiments on such devices, we find that electrostatic gating and Schottky barrier effects are the two relevant mechanisms, with electrostatic gating being most reproducible. If the contact region is passivated, sensing is shown to be dominated by electrostatic gating, which demonstrates that the sensitive part of a nanotube transistor is not limited to the contact region, as previously suggested. Such a layout provides a reliable platform for biosensing with nanotubes. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

Although biosensing is often performed at high transconductance where the device displays the largest gate response, here we show that the maximum SNR is actually obtained when the device is operated in the subthreshold regime. In the ON-state, additional contributions to the noise can lead to a reduction of the SNR by up to a factor of 5. For devices with passivated contact regions, the SNR in ON-state is even further reduced than for bare devices. We show that when the conductivity of the contact regions can be increased usi$\pi$g a conventional back gate, the SNR in the ON-state can be improved.

Towards this end, NTFETs show great promise because of their extreme environmental sensitivity, small size, and ultra-low power requirements. Despite the great progress NTFETs have shown in the field of biological sensing, debate still exists over the mechanistic origins underlying the electronic response of NTFET devices, specifically whether analyte species interact with the carbon nanotube conduction channel or if interaction with the NTFET electrodes actually triggers device response. In this tutorial review, we describe the fabrication of NTFET devices, and detail several reports that illustrate recent advances in biological detection using NTFET devices, while highlighting the suggested mechanisms explaining the device response to analyte species. In doing this we hope to show that NTFET technology has the potential for low-cost and portable bioanalytical platforms.},

abstract = {Easily fabricated random network carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNT-FETs) have benefitted from improved separation techniques to deliver CNTs with current formulations providing at least 99\% semiconducting tube content. Amongst the most promising applications of this device platform are electronic biosensors, where the network conduction is affected through tethered probes such as aptamers which act as molecular scale electrostatic gates. However, the prevailing assumption that these biosensor devices would be optimized if metallic tubes were entirely eliminated has not been examined. Here, we show that metallic-semiconducting junctions in aptasensors are sensing hotspots and that their impact on sensing is heightened by the CNT network's proximity to percolation. First, we use a biased conducting AFM tip to gate a CNT-FET at the nanoscale and demonstrate that the strongest device response occurs when gating at metallic-semiconducting junctions. Second, we resolve the target sensitivity of an aptasensor as a function of tube density and show heightened sensitivity at densities close to the percolation threshold. We find the strongest sensing response where the 1\% of metallic tubes generate a high density of metallic-semiconducting junctions but cannot form a percolated metallic path across the network. These findings highlight the critical role of metallic tubes in CNT-FET biosensor devices and demonstrate that network composition is an important variable to boost the performance of electronic biosensors.},

abstract = {We report the intrinsic water contact angle (WCA) of multilayer graphene, explore different methods of cleaning multilayer graphene, and evaluate the efficiency of those methods on the basis of spectroscopic analysis. Highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) was used as a model material system to study the wettability of the multilayer graphene surface by WCA measurements. A WCA value of 45° ± 3° was measured for a clean HOPG surface, which can serve as the intrinsic WCA for multilayer graphene. A 1 min plasma treatment (100 W) decreased the WCA to 6°, owing to the creation of surface defects and functionalization by oxygen-containing groups. Molecular dynamics simulations of water droplets on the HOPG surface with or without the oxygen-containing defect sites confirmed the experimental results. Heat treatment at near atmospheric pressure and wet chemical cleaning methods using hydrofluoric acid and chloroform did not change the WCA significantly. Low-pressure, higherature annealing under argon and hydrogen reduced the WCA to 54°, close to the intrinsic WCA of HOPG. Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy did not show any significant change for the HOPG surface after this treatment, confirming low-pressure, higherature annealing as an effective technique to clean multilayer graphene without damaging the surface. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry indicated the existence of hydrocarbon species on the surface of the HOPG sample that was exposed to air for <5 min and the absence of these impurities in the bulk. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses of the sample surfaces after the different cleaning techniques were performed to correlate the WCA to the surface chemistry. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results revealed that the WCA value changed drastically, depending on the amounts of oxygen-containing and hydrocarbon-containing groups on the surface.},

abstract = {As a two-dimensional material with high charge carrier mobility, graphene may offer ultrahigh sensitivity in biosensing. To realize this, the first step is to functionalize the graphene. This is commonly done by using 1-pyrenebutyric acid (PBA) as a linker for biomolecules. However, the adsorption of PBA on graphene remains poorly understood despite reports of successful biosensors functionalized via this route. Here, the PBA adsorption on graphene is characterized through a combination of Raman spectroscopy, ab initio calculations, and spectroscopic ellipsometry. The PBA molecules are found to form a self-assembled monolayer on graphene, the formation of which is self-limiting and Langmuirian. Intriguingly, in concentrated solutions, the PBA molecules are found to stand up and stack horizontally with their edges contacting the graphene surface. This morphology could facilitate a surface densely populated with carboxylic functional groups. Spectroscopic analyses show that the monolayer saturates at 5.3 PBA molecules per nm2 and measures ∼0.7 nm in thickness. The morphology study of this PBA monolayer sheds light on the $\pi$-$\pi$ stacking of small-molecule systems on graphene and provides an excellent base for optimizing functionalization procedures.},

With a view to graphene-based sensing arrays and devices and, in particular, in view of graphene-based varactors for gas sensing, graphene was modified in this work by the $\pi$-$\pi$interaction-driven self-assembly of 10 pyrene and cyclodextrin derivatives from solution. The receptor compounds were pyrene, pyrene derivatives with hydroxyl, carboxyl, ester, ammonium, amino, diethylamino, and boronic acid groups, and perbenzylated $\alpha$-, $\beta$-, and $\gamma$-cyclodextrins. Adsorption of these compounds onto graphene was quantified by contact-angle measurements and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Data thus obtained were fitted with the Langmuir adsorption model to determine the equilibrium constants for surface adsorption and the concentrations of self-assembly solutions needed to form dense monolayers on graphene. The equilibrium constants of all pyrene derivatives fell into the range from 103.4 to 104.6 M-1. For the perbenzylated $\alpha$-, $\beta$-, and $\gamma$-cyclodextrins, the equilibrium constants are 103.24, 102.97, and 102.95 M-1, respectively.

abstract = {Bio-inspired molecular communications (MC), where molecules are used to
transfer information, is the most promising technique to realise the Internet
of Nano Things (IoNT), thanks to its inherent biocompatibility,
energy-efficiency, and reliability in physiologically-relevant environments.
Despite a substantial body of theoretical work concerning MC, the lack of
practical micro/nanoscale MC devices and MC testbeds has led researchers to
make overly simplifying assumptions about the implications of the channel
conditions and the physical architectures of the practical transceivers in
developing theoretical models and devising communication methods for MC. On the
other hand, MC imposes unique challenges resulting from the highly complex,
nonlinear, time-varying channel properties that cannot be always tackled by
conventional information and communication tools and technologies (ICT). As a
result, the reliability of the existing MC methods, which are mostly adopted
from electromagnetic communications and not validated with practical testbeds,
is highly questionable. As the first step to remove this discrepancy, in this
study, we report on the fabrication of a nanoscale MC receiver based on
graphene field-effect transistor biosensors. We perform its ICT
characterisation in a custom-designed microfluidic MC system with the
information encoded into the concentration of single-stranded DNA molecules.
This experimental platform is the first practical implementation of a
micro/nanoscale MC system with nanoscale MC receivers, and can serve as a
testbed for developing realistic MC methods and IoNT applications.},

abstract = {Conductive materials functionalized with redox enzymes provide bioelectronic architectures with application to biological fuel cells and biosensors. Effective electron transfer between the enzyme (biocatalyst) and the conductive materials is imperative for function. Various nanostructured carbon materials are common electrode choices for these applications as both the materials' inherent conductivity and physical integrity aids optimal performance. The following chapter presents a method for the use of carbon nanotube buckypaper as a conductive architecture suitable for biocatalyst functionalization. In order to securely attach the biocatalyst to the carbon nanotube surface, the conductive buckypaper is modified with the heterobifunctional cross-linker, 1-pyrenebutanoic acid, succinimidyl ester. The technique effectively tethers the enzyme to the carbon nanotube which enhances bioelectrocatalysis, preserves the conductive nature of the carbon surface, and facilities direct electron transfer between the catalyst and material interface. The approach is demonstrated using phenol oxidase (laccase) and pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent glucose dehydrogenase PQQ-GDH, as representative biocatalysts. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, New York 2013.},

abstract = {A label-free biosensor is developed for the determination of plasma-based A$\beta$1–42 biomarker in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The platform is based on highly conductive dual-layer of graphene and electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The modification of dual-layer with 1-pyrenebutyric acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Pyr-NHS) is achieved to facilitate immobilization of H31L21 antibody. The effect of these modifications were studied with morphological, spectral and electrochemical techniques. The response of the biosensor was evaluated using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The data was acquired at a working potential of $\sim$ 180 mV and a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. A low limit of detection (LOD) of 2.398 pM is achieved over a wide linear range from 11 pM to 55 nM. The biosensor exhibits excellent specificity over A$\beta$1–40 and ApoE $\epsilon$4 interfering species. Thus, it provides a viable tool for electrochemical determination of A$\beta$1–42. Spiked human and mice plasmas were used for the successful validation of the sensing platform in bio-fluidic samples. The results obtained from mice plasma analysis concurred with the immunohistochemistry (IHC) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data obtained from brain analysis.

abstract = {This paper presents a simple and sensitive method for the real-time detection of a prostate cancer marker (PSA-ACT complex) through label-free protein biosensors based on a carbon nanotube field effect transistor (CNT-FET). Herein, the CNT-FET was functionalized with a solution containing various linker-to-spacer ratios, the binding event of the target PSA-ACT complex onto the receptor detected by monitoring the gating effect caused by charges in the target PSA-ACT complex. Since the biosensors were used in a buffer solution, it was crucial to control the distance between the receptors through introduction of linkers and spacers so that the charged target PSA-ACT complex could easily approach the CNT surface within the Debye length to give a large gating effect. The results show that CNT-FET biosensors modified with only linkers could not detect target proteins unless a very high concentration of the PSA-ACT complex solution (∼500 ng/ml) was injected, while those modified with a 1:3 ratio of linker-to-spacer could detect 1.0 ng/ml without any pretreatment. Moreover, our linker and spacer-modified CNT-FET could successfully block non-target proteins and selectively detect the target protein in human serum. Significantly, this strategy can be applied to general antibody-based detection schemes and enables production of very simple and sensitive electronic biosensors to detect clinically important biomarkers for disease diagnosis. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Zheng2016,
abstract = {Synthetic DNA aptamer receptors could boost the prospects of carbon nanotube (CNT)-based electronic biosensors if signal transduction can be understood and engineered. Here, we report CNT aptasensors for potassium ions that clearly demonstrate aptamer-induced electrostatic gating of electronic conduction. The CNT network devices were fabricated on flexible substrates via a facile solution processing route and non-covalently functionalised with potassium binding aptamers. Monotonic increases in CNT conduction were observed in response to increasing potassium ion concentration, with a level of detection as low as 10 picomolar. The signal was shown to arise from a specific aptamer-target interaction that stabilises a G-quadruplex structure, bringing high negative charge density near the CNT channel. Electrostatic gating is established via the specificity and the sign of the current response, and by observing its suppression when higher ionic strength decreases the Debye length at the CNT-water interface. Sensitivity towards potassium and selectivity against other ions is demonstrated in both resistive mode and real time transistor mode measurements. The effective device architecture presented, along with the identification of clear response signatures, should inform the development of new electronic biosensors using the growing library of aptamer receptors.},

Based on the concentration-dependent calibration curve, a dissociation constant of KD = 375.8 pM was obtained. Continuous real-time measurements were also conducted under a constant gate voltage (VGS) to observe the transient response of the sensor when analyte was introduced to the device.

abstract = {Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a gene sequence are markers for a variety of human diseases. Detection of SNPs with high specificity and sensitivity is essential for effective practical implementation of personalized medicine. Current DNA sequencing, including SNP detection, primarily uses enzyme-based methods or fluorophore-labeled assays that are time-consuming, need laboratory-scale settings, and are expensive. Previously reported electrical charge-based SNP detectors have insufficient specificity and accuracy, limiting their effectiveness. Here, we demonstrate the use of a DNA strand displacement-based probe on a graphene field effect transistor (FET) for high-specificity, single-nucleotide mismatch detection. The single mismatch was detected by measuring strand displacement-induced resistance (and hence current) change and Dirac point shift in a graphene FET. SNP detection in large double-helix DNA strands (e.g., 47 nt) minimize false-positive results. Our electrical sensor-based SNP detection technology, without labeling and without apparent cross-hybridization artifacts, would allow fast, sensitive, and portable SNP detection with single-nucleotide resolution. The technology will have a wide range of applications in digital and implantable biosensors and high-throughput DNA genotyping, with transformative implications for personalized medicine.},

abstract = {All-electronic DNA biosensors based on graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) offer the prospect of simple and cost-effective diagnostics. For GFET sensors based on complementary probe DNA, the sensitivity is limited by the binding affinity of the target oligonucleotide, in the nM range for 20 mer targets. We report a ∼20 000× improvement in sensitivity through the use of engineered hairpin probe DNA that allows for target recycling and hybridization chain reaction. This enables detection of 21 mer target DNA at sub-fM concentration and provides superior specificity against single-base mismatched oligomers. The work is based on a scalable fabrication process for biosensor arrays that is suitable for multiplexed detection. This approach overcomes the binding-affinity-dependent sensitivity of nucleic acid biosensors and offers a pathway toward multiplexed and label-free nucleic acid testing with high accuracy and selectivity.},

For the first time, we report the use of graphene functionalized by the aptamer as the bioreceptor, in conjunction with Spectral-Phase Interferometry (SPI) for detection of ochratoxin A (OTA). In a direct assay with an OTA-specific aptamer, we demonstrated a quick and significant change of the optical signal in response to the maximum tolerable level of OTA concentration.

These will be useful for therapeutic drug monitoring of azole antifungal drugs, which is necessary to deal with the complex drug dosage profiles.This technical report describes the development of an aptamer for sensing azole antifungal drugs during therapeutic drug monitoring. Modified synthetic evolution of ligands through exponential enrichment (SELEX) was used to discover a DNA aptamer recognizing azole class antifungal drugs. This aptamer undergoes a secondary structural change upon binding to its target molecule, as shown through fluorescence anisotropy-based binding measurements. Experiments using circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed a unique G-quadruplex structure that was essential and specific for binding to the azole antifungal target. Aptamer-functionalized graphene field effect transistor (GFET) devices were created and used to measure the strength of binding of azole antifungals to this surface. In total, this aptamer and the supporting sensing platform provide a valuable tool for therapeutic drug monitoring of patients with invasive fungal infections.

Their versatile physicochemical features are nonetheless limited by their scarce solubilization in both aqueous and organic solvents. In order to overcome this drawback CNTs can be easily non-covalently functionalized with different dispersants. In the present review we focus on the peculiar hydrophobic character of pristine CNTs that prevent them to easily disperse in organic solvents. We report some interesting examples of CNTs dispersants with the aim to highlight the essential features a molecule should possess in order to act as a good carbon nanotube dispersant both in water and in organic solvents. The review pinpoints also a few examples of dispersant design. The last section is devoted to the exploitation of the major quality of non-covalent functionalization that is its reversibility and the possibility to obtain stimuliresponsive precipitation or dispersion of CNTs.},

Yet, the effect of long-term bias stress on individual CNTs, critical for most sensing applications, has remained uncertain. Here, we report bias ranges under which CNT transistors can operate continuously for months or more without degradation. Using a custom characterization system, the impacts of defect formation and charge traps on the stability of CNT-based sensors under extended bias are determined. In addition to breakdown, which is well-known, we identify three additional operational modes: full stability, slow decay, and fast decay. We identify a current drift behavior that reduces dynamic range by over four orders of magnitude but is avoidable with appropriate sensing modalities. Identification of these stable operation modes and limits for nanotube-based sensors addresses concerns surrounding their development for a myriad of sensing applications.},

Understanding the adsorption and stacking behavior of these molecules and their influence on material properties is an essential step in enabling highly repeatable 2D material-based applications, such as biosensors, gas sensors, and solar cells. In this work, we characterize pyrene and peptide self-assembly on graphene substrates using fluorescence microscopy, atomic force microscopy and electrolyte-gated field-effect measurements supported by quantum mechanical calculations. We find distinct binding and assembly modes for pyrenes versus peptides with corresponding distinct electronic signatures in their characteristic charge neutrality point and field-effect slope responses. Our data demonstrates that pyrene- and peptide-based self-assembly platforms can be highly beneficial for precisely customizing graphene electronic properties for desired device technologies such as transport-based biosensing graphene field-effect transistors.},

abstract = {A simple, versatile method for non-covalent functionalization of graphene based on solution-phase assembly of alkane-amine layers is presented. Second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset (MP2) perturbation theory on a cluster model (methylamine on pyrene) yields a binding energy of ≈220 meV for the amine-graphene interaction, which is strong enough to enable formation of a stable aminodecane layer at room temperature. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations on an assembly of 1-aminodecane molecules indicate that a self-assembled monolayer can form, with the alkane chains oriented perpendicular to the graphene basal plane. The calculated monolayer height (≈1.7 nm) is in good agreement with atomic force microscopy data acquired for graphene functionalized with 1-aminodecane, which yield a continuous layer with mean thickness ≈1.7 nm, albeit with some island defects. Raman data also confirm that self-assembly of alkane-amines is a non-covalent process, i.e., it does not perturb the sp 2 hybridization of the graphene. Passivation and adsorbate n-doping of graphene field-effect devices using 1-aminodecane, as well as high-density binding of plasmonic metal nanoparticles and seeded atomic layer deposition of inorganic dielectrics using 1,10-diaminodecane are also reported.

This paper first reviews the biocompatibility of SU-8 for in vitro and in vivo applications. Surface modification techniques as well as various biomedical applications based on SU-8 are also discussed. Although SU-8 might not be completely biocompatible, existing surface modification techniques, such as O2 plasma treatment or grafting of biocompatible polymers, might be sufficient to minimize biofouling caused by SU-8. As a result, a great deal of effort has been directed to the development of SU-8-based functional devices for biomedical applications. This review includes biomedical applications such as platforms for cell culture and cell encapsulation, immunosensing, neural probes, and implantable pressure sensors. Proper treatments of SU-8 and slight modification of surfaces have enabled the SU-8 as one of the unique choices of materials in the fabrication of biomedical devices. Due to the versatility of SU-8 and comparative advantages in terms of improved Young's modulus and yield strength, we believe that SU-8-based biomedical devices would gain wider proliferation among the biomedical community in the future.},

abstract = {A graphene field-effect transistor (gFET) was non-covalently functionalised with 1-pyrenebutyric acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester and conjugated with anti-CD63 antibodies for the label-free detection of exosomes. Using a microfluidic channel, part of a graphene film was exposed to solution. The change in electrical properties of the exposed graphene created an additional minimum alongside the original Dirac point in the drain-source current (Ids) - back-gate voltage (Vg) curve. When phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was present in the channel, the additional minimum was present at a Vg lower than the original Dirac point and shifted with time when exosomes were introduced into the channel. This shift of the minimum from the PBS reference point reached saturation after 30 minutes and was observed for multiple exosome concentrations. Upon conjugation with an isotype control, sensor response to the highest concentration of exosomes was negligible in comparison to that with anti-CD63 antibody, indicating that the functionalised gFET can specifically detect exosomes at least down to 0.1 $\mu$g/mL and is sensitive to concentration. Such a gFET biosensor has not been used before for exosome sensing and could be an effective tool for the liquid-biopsy detection of exosomes as biomarkers for early-stage identification of diseases such as cancer.},

After the covalent immobilization of 5′-amino-modified 45-mer aptamers on the CNT channels, the electrical properties of the CNT-FETs were monitored in real time. The introduction of target IgE at various concentrations caused a sharp decrease in the source-drain current, and a gradual saturation was observed at lower concentrations. The amount of the net source-drain current before and after IgE introduction on the aptamer-modified CNT-FETs increased as a function of IgE concentration. The detection limit for IgE was determined as 250 pM. We have also prepared CNT-FET biosensors using a monoclonal antibody against IgE (IgE-mAb). The electrical properties of the aptamer- and antibody-modified CNT-FETs were compared. The performance of aptamer-modified CNT-FETs provided better results than the ones obtained using IgE-mAb-modified CNT-FETs under similar conditions. Thus, we suggest that the aptamer-modified CNT-FETs are promising candidates for the development of label-free protein biosensors. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

The pathogen Escherichia coli O157:H7 and the bacteriophage T7 were selected as model for bacteria and viruses, respectively, while E. coli K12 and the bacteriophage MS2 were used to assess the selectivity of the biosensor. The transduction element consisted of single-walled carbon nanotubes aligned in parallel bridging two gold electrodes to function as a chemiresistive biosensor. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) were functionalized with specific antibodies (Ab) for the different microorganisms by covalent immobilization to the non-covalently bound 1-pyrene butanoic acid succinimidyl ester.
