abstract = {All-electronic DNA biosensors based on graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) offer the prospect of simple and cost-effective diagnostics. For GFET sensors based on complementary probe DNA, the sensitivity is limited by the binding affinity of the target oligonucleotide, in the nM range for 20 mer targets. We report a ∼20 000× improvement in sensitivity through the use of engineered hairpin probe DNA that allows for target recycling and hybridization chain reaction. This enables detection of 21 mer target DNA at sub-fM concentration and provides superior specificity against single-base mismatched oligomers. The work is based on a scalable fabrication process for biosensor arrays that is suitable for multiplexed detection. This approach overcomes the binding-affinity-dependent sensitivity of nucleic acid biosensors and offers a pathway toward multiplexed and label-free nucleic acid testing with high accuracy and selectivity.},

This aptamer undergoes a secondary structural change upon binding to its target molecule, as shown through fluorescence anisotropy-based binding measurements. Experiments using circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed a unique G-quadruplex structure that was essential and specific for binding to the azole antifungal target. Aptamer-functionalized graphene field effect transistor (GFET) devices were created and used to measure the strength of binding of azole antifungals to this surface. In total, this aptamer and the supporting sensing platform provide a valuable tool for therapeutic drug monitoring of patients with invasive fungal infections.

abstract = {Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a gene sequence are markers for a variety of human diseases. Detection of SNPs with high specificity and sensitivity is essential for effective practical implementation of personalized medicine. Current DNA sequencing, including SNP detection, primarily uses enzyme-based methods or fluorophore-labeled assays that are time-consuming, need laboratory-scale settings, and are expensive. Previously reported electrical charge-based SNP detectors have insufficient specificity and accuracy, limiting their effectiveness. Here, we demonstrate the use of a DNA strand displacement-based probe on a graphene field effect transistor (FET) for high-specificity, single-nucleotide mismatch detection. The single mismatch was detected by measuring strand displacement-induced resistance (and hence current) change and Dirac point shift in a graphene FET. SNP detection in large double-helix DNA strands (e.g., 47 nt) minimize false-positive results. Our electrical sensor-based SNP detection technology, without labeling and without apparent cross-hybridization artifacts, would allow fast, sensitive, and portable SNP detection with single-nucleotide resolution. The technology will have a wide range of applications in digital and implantable biosensors and high-throughput DNA genotyping, with transformative implications for personalized medicine.},

abstract = {Reliable determination of binding kinetics and affinity of DNA hybridization and single-base mismatches plays an essential role in systems biology, personalized and precision medicine. The standard tools are optical-based sensors that are difficult to operate in low cost and to miniaturize for high-throughput measurement. Biosensors based on nanowire field-effect transistors have been developed, but reliable and cost-effective fabrication remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate that a graphene single-crystal domain patterned into multiple channels can measure time- and concentration-dependent DNA hybridization kinetics and affinity reliably and sensitively, with a detection limit of 10 pM for DNA. It can distinguish single-base mutations quantitatively in real time. An analytical model is developed to estimate probe density, efficiency of hybridization and the maximum sensor response. The results suggest a promising future for cost-effective, high-throughput screening of drug candidates, genetic variations and disease biomarkers by using an integrated, miniaturized, all-electrical multiplexed, graphene-based DNA array. Monitoring DNA binding and single-base mismatches accurately in real time is difficult, especially for miniaturized devices.

The graphene-FET detects HA binding to sialic acid, and NA cleavage of sialic acid. The inhibitory effect of the drug “zanamivir” on NA-sialic acid interactions is monitored in real-time; the reaction rate constant of NA-sialic acid reaction was successfully determined.

A planar Au electrode was used as gate electrode integrated with graphene field-effect transistors (FETs) to generate perpendicular electrical fields between the gate and the graphene substrate. Graphene film was then transferred to cover indium tin oxide films which were used as drain and source electrodes. Via this process, the contact resistance between graphene and electrodes which were caused by polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) residues in chemical vapor deposition process was almost eliminated. An electrical detecting system was designed to detect equivalent resistance of the FETs, which indicated that the performance of the FETs was associated with the width of conducting channel, the electrical field intensity between gate and graphene, and the ion concentration of electrolyte. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was selected as model electrolyte to verify the detecting system in this study. It was demonstrated that the integrated FETs could achieve high sensitivity to detect ATP as low as 10 pM and the equivalent resistance of the FETs showed a good correlation with ATP concentration from 10 pM to 10 $\mu$M. These results may provide a better direction and a common detecting platform for the design of integrated graphene FETs biosensors. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

The effect of these modifications were studied with morphological, spectral and electrochemical techniques. The response of the biosensor was evaluated using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV).

The biosensor exhibits excellent specificity over A$\beta$1–40 and ApoE $\epsilon$4 interfering species. Thus, it provides a viable tool for electrochemical determination of A$\beta$1–42.

abstract = {This paper presents a simple and sensitive method for the real-time detection of a prostate cancer marker (PSA-ACT complex) through label-free protein biosensors based on a carbon nanotube field effect transistor (CNT-FET). Herein, the CNT-FET was functionalized with a solution containing various linker-to-spacer ratios, the binding event of the target PSA-ACT complex onto the receptor detected by monitoring the gating effect caused by charges in the target PSA-ACT complex. Since the biosensors were used in a buffer solution, it was crucial to control the distance between the receptors through introduction of linkers and spacers so that the charged target PSA-ACT complex could easily approach the CNT surface within the Debye length to give a large gating effect. The results show that CNT-FET biosensors modified with only linkers could not detect target proteins unless a very high concentration of the PSA-ACT complex solution (∼500 ng/ml) was injected, while those modified with a 1:3 ratio of linker-to-spacer could detect 1.0 ng/ml without any pretreatment. Moreover, our linker and spacer-modified CNT-FET could successfully block non-target proteins and selectively detect the target protein in human serum. Significantly, this strategy can be applied to general antibody-based detection schemes and enables production of very simple and sensitive electronic biosensors to detect clinically important biomarkers for disease diagnosis. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Zheng2016,
abstract = {Synthetic DNA aptamer receptors could boost the prospects of carbon nanotube (CNT)-based electronic biosensors if signal transduction can be understood and engineered. Here, we report CNT aptasensors for potassium ions that clearly demonstrate aptamer-induced electrostatic gating of electronic conduction. The CNT network devices were fabricated on flexible substrates via a facile solution processing route and non-covalently functionalised with potassium binding aptamers. Monotonic increases in CNT conduction were observed in response to increasing potassium ion concentration, with a level of detection as low as 10 picomolar. The signal was shown to arise from a specific aptamer–target interaction that stabilises a G-quadruplex structure, bringing high negative charge density near the CNT channel. Electrostatic gating is established via the specificity and the sign of the current response, and by observing its suppression when higher ionic strength decreases the Debye length at the CNT–water interface. Sensitivity towards potassium and selectivity against other ions is demonstrated in both resistive mode and real time transistor mode measurements. The effective device architecture presented, along with the identification of clear response signatures, should inform the development of new electronic biosensors using the growing library of aptamer receptors.},

The aptamer was developed inhouse by capillary electrophoresis systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (CE-SELEX) and had a dissociation constant (Kd) of 112 nM. The aptasensor displayed a wide dynamic range spanning up to 800 nM with a detection limit of 1 nM. The sensitivity was 0.11 per nM, and it was reusable six times. The aptasensor was also highly selective for PA toxin with no interference from human and bovine serum albumin, demonstrating it as a potential tool for rapid and point-of-care diagnosis for anthrax. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {The paper reports carbon nanotube (CNT)-based immunosensors for the detection of two types of microorganisms, bacteria and viruses. The pathogen Escherichia coli O157:H7 and the bacteriophage T7 were selected as model for bacteria and viruses, respectively, while E. coli K12 and the bacteriophage MS2 were used to assess the selectivity of the biosensor. The transduction element consisted of single-walled carbon nanotubes aligned in parallel bridging two gold electrodes to function as a chemiresistive biosensor. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) were functionalized with specific antibodies (Ab) for the different microorganisms by covalent immobilization to the non-covalently bound 1-pyrene butanoic acid succinimidyl ester. A significant increase in the resistance of the device was observed when the biosensor was exposed to E. coli O157:H7 whole cells or lysates with a limit of detection of 105 and 103CFU (colony forming units)/mL, corresponding to 103 and 101CFU/chip, respectively, while no response was observed when the biosensor was exposed to the E. coli K12. In the case of virus detection, a significant resistance increase was detected due to interaction of the bacteriophages with the Abs, with a limit of detection of 103PFU/mL corresponding to 101PFU/chip and excellent selectivity against MS2 bacteriophage. The sensor exhibited a fast response time of ∼5min in the case of bacteriophage detection, while the response time for the detection of bacteria was 60min. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We have fabricated label-free protein biosensors based on aptamer-modified carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNT-FETs) for the detection of immunoglobulin E (IgE). After the covalent immobilization of 5′-amino-modified 45-mer aptamers on the CNT channels, the electrical properties of the CNT-FETs were monitored in real time. The introduction of target IgE at various concentrations caused a sharp decrease in the source-drain current, and a gradual saturation was observed at lower concentrations. The amount of the net source-drain current before and after IgE introduction on the aptamer-modified CNT-FETs increased as a function of IgE concentration. The detection limit for IgE was determined as 250 pM. We have also prepared CNT-FET biosensors using a monoclonal antibody against IgE (IgE-mAb). The electrical properties of the aptamer- and antibody-modified CNT-FETs were compared. The performance of aptamer-modified CNT-FETs provided better results than the ones obtained using IgE-mAb-modified CNT-FETs under similar conditions. Thus, we suggest that the aptamer-modified CNT-FETs are promising candidates for the development of label-free protein biosensors. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {A graphene field-effect transistor (gFET) was non-covalently functionalised with 1-pyrenebutyric acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester and conjugated with anti-CD63 antibodies for the label-free detection of exosomes. Using a microfluidic channel, part of a graphene film was exposed to solution. The change in electrical properties of the exposed graphene created an additional minimum alongside the original Dirac point in the drain-source current (Ids) - back-gate voltage (Vg) curve. When phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was present in the channel, the additional minimum was present at a Vg lower than the original Dirac point and shifted with time when exosomes were introduced into the channel. This shift of the minimum from the PBS reference point reached saturation after 30 minutes and was observed for multiple exosome concentrations. Upon conjugation with an isotype control, sensor response to the highest concentration of exosomes was negligible in comparison to that with anti-CD63 antibody, indicating that the functionalised gFET can specifically detect exosomes at least down to 0.1 $\mu$g/mL and is sensitive to concentration. Such a gFET biosensor has not been used before for exosome sensing and could be an effective tool for the liquid-biopsy detection of exosomes as biomarkers for early-stage identification of diseases such as cancer.},
