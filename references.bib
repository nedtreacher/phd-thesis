abstract = {Interest in point-of-care diagnostics has led to increasing demand for the development of nanomaterial-based electronic biosensors such as biosensor field-effect transistors (BioFETs) due to their inherent simplicity, sensitivity, and scalability. The utility of BioFETs, which use electrical transduction to detect biological signals, is directly dependent upon their electrical stability in detection-relevant environments. However, BioFET device structures vary substantially, especially in electrode passivation modalities. Improper passivation of electronic components in ionic solutions can lead to excessive leakage currents and signal drift, thus presenting a hinderance to signal detectability. Here, we harness the sensitivity of nanomaterials to study the effects of various passivation strategies on the performance and stability of a biosensing platform based on aerosol-jet-printed carbon nanotube thin-film transistors. Specifically, nonpassivated devices were compared to devices passivated with photoresist (SU-8), dielectric (HfO2), or photoresist + dielectric (SU-8 followed by HfO2) and were evaluated primarily by initial performance metrics, large-scale device yield, and stability throughout long-duration cycling in phosphate buffered saline. We find that all three passivation conditions result in improved device performance compared to nonpassivated devices, with the photoresist + dielectric strategy providing the lowest average leakage current in solution ($\sim$ 2 nA). Notably, the photoresist + dielectric strategy also results in the greatest yield of BioFET devices meeting our selected performance criteria on a wafer scale ($\sim$ 90\%), the highest long-term stability in solution (>0.01\% change in on-current), and the best average on/off-current ratio ($\sim$ 104), hysteresis ($\sim$ 32 mV), and subthreshold swing ($\sim$ 192 mV/decade). This passivation schema has the potential to pave the path toward a truly high-yield, stable, and robust electrical biosensing platform.},

abstract = {We report the intrinsic water contact angle (WCA) of multilayer graphene, explore different methods of cleaning multilayer graphene, and evaluate the efficiency of those methods on the basis of spectroscopic analysis. Highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) was used as a model material system to study the wettability of the multilayer graphene surface by WCA measurements. A WCA value of 45° ± 3° was measured for a clean HOPG surface, which can serve as the intrinsic WCA for multilayer graphene. A 1 min plasma treatment (100 W) decreased the WCA to 6°, owing to the creation of surface defects and functionalization by oxygen-containing groups. Molecular dynamics simulations of water droplets on the HOPG surface with or without the oxygen-containing defect sites confirmed the experimental results. Heat treatment at near atmospheric pressure and wet chemical cleaning methods using hydrofluoric acid and chloroform did not change the WCA significantly. Low-pressure, higherature annealing under argon and hydrogen reduced the WCA to 54°, close to the intrinsic WCA of HOPG. Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy did not show any significant change for the HOPG surface after this treatment, confirming low-pressure, higherature annealing as an effective technique to clean multilayer graphene without damaging the surface. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry indicated the existence of hydrocarbon species on the surface of the HOPG sample that was exposed to air for <5 min and the absence of these impurities in the bulk. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses of the sample surfaces after the different cleaning techniques were performed to correlate the WCA to the surface chemistry. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results revealed that the WCA value changed drastically, depending on the amounts of oxygen-containing and hydrocarbon-containing groups on the surface.},

abstract = {All-electronic DNA biosensors based on graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) offer the prospect of simple and cost-effective diagnostics. For GFET sensors based on complementary probe DNA, the sensitivity is limited by the binding affinity of the target oligonucleotide, in the nM range for 20 mer targets. We report a ∼20 000× improvement in sensitivity through the use of engineered hairpin probe DNA that allows for target recycling and hybridization chain reaction. This enables detection of 21 mer target DNA at sub-fM concentration and provides superior specificity against single-base mismatched oligomers. The work is based on a scalable fabrication process for biosensor arrays that is suitable for multiplexed detection. This approach overcomes the binding-affinity-dependent sensitivity of nucleic acid biosensors and offers a pathway toward multiplexed and label-free nucleic acid testing with high accuracy and selectivity.},

@article{Heller2008,
abstract = {Carbon nanotube transistors have outstanding potential for electronic detection of biomolecules in solution. The physical mechanism underlying sensing however remains controversial, which hampers full exploitation of these promising nanosensors. Previously suggested mechanisms are electrostatic gating, changes in gate coupling, carrier mobility changes, and Schottky barrier effects. We argue that each mechanism has its characteristic effect on the liquid gate potential dependence of the device conductance. By studying both the electron and hole conduction, the sensing mechanisms can be unambiguously identified. From extensive protein-adsorption experiments on such devices, we find that electrostatic gating and Schottky barrier effects are the two relevant mechanisms, with electrostatic gating being most reproducible. If the contact region is passivated, sensing is shown to be dominated by electrostatic gating, which demonstrates that the sensitive part of a nanotube transistor is not limited to the contact region, as previously suggested. Such a layout provides a reliable platform for biosensing with nanotubes. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

Although biosensing is often performed at high transconductance where the device displays the largest gate response, here we show that the maximum SNR is actually obtained when the device is operated in the subthreshold regime. In the ON-state, additional contributions to the noise can lead to a reduction of the SNR by up to a factor of 5. For devices with passivated contact regions, the SNR in ON-state is even further reduced than for bare devices. We show that when the conductivity of the contact regions can be increased usi$\pi$g a conventional back gate, the SNR in the ON-state can be improved. The results presented here demonstrate that biosensing experiments are best performed in the subthreshold regime for optimal SNR.},

abstract = {As a two-dimensional material with high charge carrier mobility, graphene may offer ultrahigh sensitivity in biosensing. To realize this, the first step is to functionalize the graphene. This is commonly done by using 1-pyrenebutyric acid (PBA) as a linker for biomolecules. However, the adsorption of PBA on graphene remains poorly understood despite reports of successful biosensors functionalized via this route. Here, the PBA adsorption on graphene is characterized through a combination of Raman spectroscopy, ab initio calculations, and spectroscopic ellipsometry. The PBA molecules are found to form a self-assembled monolayer on graphene, the formation of which is self-limiting and Langmuirian. Intriguingly, in concentrated solutions, the PBA molecules are found to stand up and stack horizontally with their edges contacting the graphene surface. This morphology could facilitate a surface densely populated with carboxylic functional groups. Spectroscopic analyses show that the monolayer saturates at 5.3 PBA molecules per nm2 and measures ∼0.7 nm in thickness. The morphology study of this PBA monolayer sheds light on the $\pi$-$\pi$ stacking of small-molecule systems on graphene and provides an excellent base for optimizing functionalization procedures.},

abstract = {Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a gene sequence are markers for a variety of human diseases. Detection of SNPs with high specificity and sensitivity is essential for effective practical implementation of personalized medicine. Current DNA sequencing, including SNP detection, primarily uses enzyme-based methods or fluorophore-labeled assays that are time-consuming, need laboratory-scale settings, and are expensive. Previously reported electrical charge-based SNP detectors have insufficient specificity and accuracy, limiting their effectiveness. Here, we demonstrate the use of a DNA strand displacement-based probe on a graphene field effect transistor (FET) for high-specificity, single-nucleotide mismatch detection. The single mismatch was detected by measuring strand displacement-induced resistance (and hence current) change and Dirac point shift in a graphene FET. SNP detection in large double-helix DNA strands (e.g., 47 nt) minimize false-positive results. Our electrical sensor-based SNP detection technology, without labeling and without apparent cross-hybridization artifacts, would allow fast, sensitive, and portable SNP detection with single-nucleotide resolution. The technology will have a wide range of applications in digital and implantable biosensors and high-throughput DNA genotyping, with transformative implications for personalized medicine.},

Despite the great progress NTFETs have shown in the field of biological sensing, debate still exists over the mechanistic origins underlying the electronic response of NTFET devices, specifically whether analyte species interact with the carbon nanotube conduction channel or if interaction with the NTFET electrodes actually triggers device response. In this tutorial review, we describe the fabrication of NTFET devices, and detail several reports that illustrate recent advances in biological detection using NTFET devices, while highlighting the suggested mechanisms explaining the device response to analyte species. In doing this we hope to show that NTFET technology has the potential for low-cost and portable bioanalytical platforms.},

abstract = {This paper presents a simple and sensitive method for the real-time detection of a prostate cancer marker (PSA-ACT complex) through label-free protein biosensors based on a carbon nanotube field effect transistor (CNT-FET). Herein, the CNT-FET was functionalized with a solution containing various linker-to-spacer ratios, the binding event of the target PSA-ACT complex onto the receptor detected by monitoring the gating effect caused by charges in the target PSA-ACT complex. Since the biosensors were used in a buffer solution, it was crucial to control the distance between the receptors through introduction of linkers and spacers so that the charged target PSA-ACT complex could easily approach the CNT surface within the Debye length to give a large gating effect. The results show that CNT-FET biosensors modified with only linkers could not detect target proteins unless a very high concentration of the PSA-ACT complex solution (∼500 ng/ml) was injected, while those modified with a 1:3 ratio of linker-to-spacer could detect 1.0 ng/ml without any pretreatment. Moreover, our linker and spacer-modified CNT-FET could successfully block non-target proteins and selectively detect the target protein in human serum. Significantly, this strategy can be applied to general antibody-based detection schemes and enables production of very simple and sensitive electronic biosensors to detect clinically important biomarkers for disease diagnosis. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Thermal oxidation produced Al 2 O 3 with a thickness and structure that depended on the process time and temperature. The MIS capacitors exhibited the charge regimes of accumulation, depletion, and inversion on the Si semiconductor surface. The best electrical properties were obtained when all of the AlN was fully oxidized to Al 2 O 3 with no residual AlN. The MIS flatband voltage was near 0 V, the net oxide trapped charge density, ox , was less than 10 11 cm 2 , and the interface trap density, , was less than 10 11 cm 2 eV 1. At an oxide electric field of 0.3 MV/cm, the leakage current density was less than 10 7 A cm 2 , with a resistivity greater than 10 12-cm. The critical field for dielectric breakdown ranged from 4 to 5 MV/cm. The temperature dependence of the current versus electric field indicated that the conduction mechanism was Frenkel-Poole emission, which has the interesting property that higher temperatures reduce the current. This may be important for the reliability of circuits operating under extreme conditions. The dielectric constant ranged from 3 to 9.

abstract = {Bio-inspired molecular communications (MC), where molecules are used to
transfer information, is the most promising technique to realise the Internet
of Nano Things (IoNT), thanks to its inherent biocompatibility,
energy-efficiency, and reliability in physiologically-relevant environments.
Despite a substantial body of theoretical work concerning MC, the lack of
practical micro/nanoscale MC devices and MC testbeds has led researchers to
make overly simplifying assumptions about the implications of the channel
conditions and the physical architectures of the practical transceivers in
developing theoretical models and devising communication methods for MC. On the
other hand, MC imposes unique challenges resulting from the highly complex,
nonlinear, time-varying channel properties that cannot be always tackled by
conventional information and communication tools and technologies (ICT). As a
result, the reliability of the existing MC methods, which are mostly adopted
from electromagnetic communications and not validated with practical testbeds,
is highly questionable. As the first step to remove this discrepancy, in this
study, we report on the fabrication of a nanoscale MC receiver based on
graphene field-effect transistor biosensors. We perform its ICT
characterisation in a custom-designed microfluidic MC system with the
information encoded into the concentration of single-stranded DNA molecules.
This experimental platform is the first practical implementation of a
micro/nanoscale MC system with nanoscale MC receivers, and can serve as a

A technique for covalently bonding heme-b (hemin), a natural quinohemoprotein porphyrin redox cofactor, to carbon nanotubes modified with arylamine groups is reported. The resulting performance of the covalently bound hemin PQQ-sGDH anode is considerably higher than that of any other PQQ-sGDH anodes tested.},

The interferometric sensor chips are fabricated via a conventional wet transfer method of CVD-grown graphene onto the glass coverslips, lowering the device cost and allowing for upscaling the sensor fabrication. For the first time, we report the use of graphene functionalized by the aptamer as the bioreceptor, in conjunction with Spectral-Phase Interferometry (SPI) for detection of ochratoxin A (OTA). In a direct assay with an OTA-specific aptamer, we demonstrated a quick and significant change of the optical signal in response to the maximum tolerable level of OTA concentration.

The platform is based on highly conductive dual-layer of graphene and electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The modification of dual-layer with 1-pyrenebutyric acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Pyr-NHS) is achieved to facilitate immobilization of H31L21 antibody. The effect of these modifications were studied with morphological, spectral and electrochemical techniques. The response of the biosensor was evaluated using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The data was acquired at a working potential of $\sim$ 180 mV and a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. A low limit of detection (LOD) of 2.398 pM is achieved over a wide linear range from 11 pM to 55 nM. The biosensor exhibits excellent specificity over A$\beta$1–40 and ApoE $\epsilon$4 interfering species. Thus, it provides a viable tool for electrochemical determination of A$\beta$1–42. Spiked human and mice plasmas were used for the successful validation of the sensing platform in bio-fluidic samples.

Upon simple and rapid thermal desorption of these species we were able to fully recover the water affinity in these CNT networks.

Effective electron transfer between the enzyme (biocatalyst) and the conductive materials is imperative for function. Various nanostructured carbon materials are common electrode choices for these applications as both the materials' inherent conductivity and physical integrity aids optimal performance. The following chapter presents a method for the use of carbon nanotube buckypaper as a conductive architecture suitable for biocatalyst functionalization. In order to securely attach the biocatalyst to the carbon nanotube surface, the conductive buckypaper is modified with the heterobifunctional cross-linker, 1-pyrenebutanoic acid, succinimidyl ester. The technique effectively tethers the enzyme to the carbon nanotube which enhances bioelectrocatalysis, preserves the conductive nature of the carbon surface, and facilities direct electron transfer between the catalyst and material interface. The approach is demonstrated using phenol oxidase (laccase) and pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent glucose dehydrogenase PQQ-GDH, as representative biocatalysts. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, New York 2013.},

abstract = {Easily fabricated random network carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNT-FETs) have benefitted from improved separation techniques to deliver CNTs with current formulations providing at least 99\% semiconducting tube content. Amongst the most promising applications of this device platform are electronic biosensors, where the network conduction is affected through tethered probes such as aptamers which act as molecular scale electrostatic gates. However, the prevailing assumption that these biosensor devices would be optimized if metallic tubes were entirely eliminated has not been examined. Here, we show that metallic-semiconducting junctions in aptasensors are sensing hotspots and that their impact on sensing is heightened by the CNT network's proximity to percolation. First, we use a biased conducting AFM tip to gate a CNT-FET at the nanoscale and demonstrate that the strongest device response occurs when gating at metallic-semiconducting junctions. Second, we resolve the target sensitivity of an aptasensor as a function of tube density and show heightened sensitivity at densities close to the percolation threshold. We find the strongest sensing response where the 1\% of metallic tubes generate a high density of metallic-semiconducting junctions but cannot form a percolated metallic path across the network. These findings highlight the critical role of metallic tubes in CNT-FET biosensor devices and demonstrate that network composition is an important variable to boost the performance of electronic biosensors.},

abstract = {Surprisingly few details have been reported in the literature that help the experimentalist to determine the conditions necessary for the preparation of self-assembled monolayers on graphene with a high surface coverage. With a view to graphene-based sensing arrays and devices and, in particular, in view of graphene-based varactors for gas sensing, graphene was modified in this work by the $\pi$-$\pi$interaction-driven self-assembly of 10 pyrene and cyclodextrin derivatives from solution. The receptor compounds were pyrene, pyrene derivatives with hydroxyl, carboxyl, ester, ammonium, amino, diethylamino, and boronic acid groups, and perbenzylated $\alpha$-, $\beta$-, and $\gamma$-cyclodextrins. Adsorption of these compounds onto graphene was quantified by contact-angle measurements and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Data thus obtained were fitted with the Langmuir adsorption model to determine the equilibrium constants for surface adsorption and the concentrations of self-assembly solutions needed to form dense monolayers on graphene. The equilibrium constants of all pyrene derivatives fell into the range from 103.4 to 104.6 M-1. For the perbenzylated $\alpha$-, $\beta$-, and $\gamma$-cyclodextrins, the equilibrium constants are 103.24, 102.97, and 102.95 M-1, respectively. Monolayers of 1-pyrenemethylammonium chloride on graphene were confirmed to be stable under heating to 100 °C in a high vacuum (2 × 10-5 Torr).},

abstract = {Synthetic DNA aptamer receptors could boost the prospects of carbon nanotube (CNT)-based electronic biosensors if signal transduction can be understood and engineered. Here, we report CNT aptasensors for potassium ions that clearly demonstrate aptamer-induced electrostatic gating of electronic conduction. The CNT network devices were fabricated on flexible substrates via a facile solution processing route and non-covalently functionalised with potassium binding aptamers. Monotonic increases in CNT conduction were observed in response to increasing potassium ion concentration, with a level of detection as low as 10 picomolar. The signal was shown to arise from a specific aptamer-target interaction that stabilises a G-quadruplex structure, bringing high negative charge density near the CNT channel. Electrostatic gating is established via the specificity and the sign of the current response, and by observing its suppression when higher ionic strength decreases the Debye length at the CNT-water interface. Sensitivity towards potassium and selectivity against other ions is demonstrated in both resistive mode and real time transistor mode measurements.

abstract = {This paper explores the possibility of using arrays of metallic carbon nanotubes as sensors. Unlike their semiconducting counterparts, single-walled carbon nanotube arrays or networks that are dominated by metallic conduction pathways have not been investigated for their environmental sensitivity. In this work, we demonstrate transduction of molecular adsorption via charge transfer through predominantly metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes. Raman spectroscopy and electric field dependent transport confirm that signal transduction takes place through primarily large diameter metallic nanotubes. This unique signal transduction mechanism might have implications for novel sensors. The scaling of the signal with array impedance is well described using an irreversible binding model developed previously. The arrays have several advantages including a simple, two-electrode fabrication, rapid regeneration, and a responsivity that scales predictably and linearly with the number of adsorption sites. An array-assisted hydrolysis of reactive analytes is found to regenerate the nanotube surface from hydrolyzable species which include important organophosphate nerve agents. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Nowadays, there is a high demand for sensitive and selective real-time analytical methods suitable for a wide range of applications, from personalized telemedicine, drug discovery, food safety, and quality control, to defense, security, as well as environmental monitoring. Biosensors are analytical devices able to detect bio-chemical analytes (e.g., neurotransmitters, cancer biomarkers, bio-molecules, and ions), through the combination of a bio-recognition element and a bio-transduction device. The use of customized bio-recognition elements such as enzymes, antibodies, aptamers, and ion-selective membranes facilitates achieving high selectivity. Among the different bio-transduction devices currently available, electrolyte-gated field-effect transistors, in which the dielectric is represented by an ionic liquid buffer solution containing the targeted analyte, are gaining increasing attention. Indeed, these bio-transduction devices are characterized by superior electronic properties and intrinsic signal amplification that allow the detection of a wide range of bio-molecules with high sensitivity (down to pM concentration). A promising semiconducting material for bio-transduction devices is represented by carbon nanotubes, due to their unique electrical properties, nanosize, bio-compatibility, and their simple low-cost processability. This work provides a comprehensive and critical review of electrolyte-gated carbon nanotube field-effect transistor-based biosensors. First, an introduction to these bio-sensing devices is given. Next, the device configurations and operating principles are presented, and the most used materials and processes are reviewed with a particular focus on carbon nanotubes as the active material. Subsequently, different functionalization strategies reported in the literature, based on enzymes, antibodies, aptamers, and ion-selective membranes, are analyzed critically. Finally, present issues and challenges faced in the area are investigated, the conclusions are drawn, and a perspective outlook over the field of bio-sensing technologies, in general, is provided.},

abstract = {SU-8 is an epoxy-based, negative-tone photoresist that has been extensively utilized to fabricate myriads of devices including biomedical devices in the recent years. This paper first reviews the biocompatibility of SU-8 for in vitro and in vivo applications. Surface modification techniques as well as various biomedical applications based on SU-8 are also discussed. Although SU-8 might not be completely biocompatible, existing surface modification techniques, such as O2 plasma treatment or grafting of biocompatible polymers, might be sufficient to minimize biofouling caused by SU-8. As a result, a great deal of effort has been directed to the development of SU-8-based functional devices for biomedical applications. This review includes biomedical applications such as platforms for cell culture and cell encapsulation, immunosensing, neural probes, and implantable pressure sensors. Proper treatments of SU-8 and slight modification of surfaces have enabled the SU-8 as one of the unique choices of materials in the fabrication of biomedical devices. Due to the versatility of SU-8 and comparative advantages in terms of improved Young's modulus and yield strength, we believe that SU-8-based biomedical devices would gain wider proliferation among the biomedical community in the future.},

abstract = {A graphene field-effect transistor (gFET) was non-covalently functionalised with 1-pyrenebutyric acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester and conjugated with anti-CD63 antibodies for the label-free detection of exosomes. Using a microfluidic channel, part of a graphene film was exposed to solution. The change in electrical properties of the exposed graphene created an additional minimum alongside the original Dirac point in the drain-source current (Ids) - back-gate voltage (Vg) curve. When phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was present in the channel, the additional minimum was present at a Vg lower than the original Dirac point and shifted with time when exosomes were introduced into the channel. This shift of the minimum from the PBS reference point reached saturation after 30 minutes and was observed for multiple exosome concentrations. Upon conjugation with an isotype control, sensor response to the highest concentration of exosomes was negligible in comparison to that with anti-CD63 antibody, indicating that the functionalised gFET can specifically detect exosomes at least down to 0.1 $\mu$g/mL and is sensitive to concentration. Such a gFET biosensor has not been used before for exosome sensing and could be an effective tool for the liquid-biopsy detection of exosomes as biomarkers for early-stage identification of diseases such as cancer.},

abstract = {We have fabricated label-free protein biosensors based on aptamer-modified carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNT-FETs) for the detection of immunoglobulin E (IgE). After the covalent immobilization of 5′-amino-modified 45-mer aptamers on the CNT channels, the electrical properties of the CNT-FETs were monitored in real time. The introduction of target IgE at various concentrations caused a sharp decrease in the source-drain current, and a gradual saturation was observed at lower concentrations. The amount of the net source-drain current before and after IgE introduction on the aptamer-modified CNT-FETs increased as a function of IgE concentration. The detection limit for IgE was determined as 250 pM. We have also prepared CNT-FET biosensors using a monoclonal antibody against IgE (IgE-mAb). The electrical properties of the aptamer- and antibody-modified CNT-FETs were compared. The performance of aptamer-modified CNT-FETs provided better results than the ones obtained using IgE-mAb-modified CNT-FETs under similar conditions. Thus, we suggest that the aptamer-modified CNT-FETs are promising candidates for the development of label-free protein biosensors. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {The paper reports carbon nanotube (CNT)-based immunosensors for the detection of two types of microorganisms, bacteria and viruses. The pathogen Escherichia coli O157:H7 and the bacteriophage T7 were selected as model for bacteria and viruses, respectively, while E. coli K12 and the bacteriophage MS2 were used to assess the selectivity of the biosensor. The transduction element consisted of single-walled carbon nanotubes aligned in parallel bridging two gold electrodes to function as a chemiresistive biosensor. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) were functionalized with specific antibodies (Ab) for the different microorganisms by covalent immobilization to the non-covalently bound 1-pyrene butanoic acid succinimidyl ester. A significant increase in the resistance of the device was observed when the biosensor was exposed to E. coli O157:H7 whole cells or lysates with a limit of detection of 105 and 103CFU (colony forming units)/mL, corresponding to 103 and 101CFU/chip, respectively, while no response was observed when the biosensor was exposed to the E. coli K12. In the case of virus detection, a significant resistance increase was detected due to interaction of the bacteriophages with the Abs, with a limit of detection of 103PFU/mL corresponding to 101PFU/chip and excellent selectivity against MS2 bacteriophage. The sensor exhibited a fast response time of ∼5min in the case of bacteriophage detection, while the response time for the detection of bacteria was 60min. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},
