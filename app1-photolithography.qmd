# Photolithography {#sec-photolithography}

![A side-view comparison of generic photolithography processes for positive and negative resists in the ideal case. Photolithography with a positive resist requires a single softbake step before exposure, while for negative resists a second baking step is required after exposure (Thicknesses shown not to scale).](figures/app1/positive-negative-photolithography.png){#fig-photolithography-types}

This section details some of the standard photolithography procedures used in the device fabrication processes detailed in @sec-fabrication. Photoresists, also referred to here as "resists", are UV light-sensitive polymeric resins used for photolithography. Both positive and negative photoresists were used in various fabrication processes. Positive resists are made soluble in alkalines by UV light exposure, meaning exposed areas are removed in the development process. Conversely, negative resists are cross-linked by exposure and a post-exposure bake step. The unexposed areas of the negative resist are then removed in the development process [@Microchemicals]. @fig-photolithography-types gives a visual representation of these differences.

Two different resist profiles seen for different types of photoresist. Each profile has had the central region of the substrate exposed to UV light prior to development.  The undercut profile is ideal for thin-film metal deposition and subsequent patterned removal, known as "lift-off". 
:::

The specific photoresist selected for photolithography depends on the specific use case. The types used in this thesis are positive and negative AZ$^\circledR$ photoresists (AZ$^\circledR$ 1518, Microchemicals GmbH; AZ$^\circledR$ nLOF 2020, Microchemicals GmbH) and SU-8 (SU8-2150, Kayaku Advanced Materials, formerly Microchem). The AZ$^\circledR$ resists used here have a minimum film thickness of $1.5\textrm{ } \mu \textrm{m}$ [@Microchemicals], while the SU8-2150 has a minimum film thickness of $0.5\textrm{ } \mu \textrm{m}$ [@Kayaku]. Positive resists which have not been thermally crosslinked will soften at higher temperatures ($\gtrsim 100^\circ$C for AZ$^\circledR$ 1518), leading to a rounded profile. This is not the case for negative resists, which are more thermally stable [@Microchemicals]. Each resist therefore has a different cross-section profile, as shown in @fig-photolithography-profiles. 

If metal deposition is performed on a positive resist, some metal can collect on the outwardly-sloped sidewalls of the resist (see @fig-photolithography-profiles) which forms significant spikes on the edges of the deposited metal upon lift-off. On the other hand, metal cannot collect on top of the inwardly-sloped negative profile sidewalls, which avoids the formation of large edge spikes. Therefore, the negative resist profile is more suited to metal or metal oxide deposition and lift-off processes, though the process is more sensitive to human error due to requiring more processing steps than positive resist [@Microchemicals]. Finally, when it is suitably processed SU-8 is considered to be more stable and biocompatible than other photoresists [@Albarghouthi2022]. It is especially biocompatible when chemically modified via processes such as isopropanol sonication and O$_2$ plasma treatment [@Chen2021].

All photolithographic exposure was performed using a Karl Suss MJB3 Contact Aligner with a USHIO super-high pressure 350 W mercury lamp (USH-350DS, Japan). When performing photolithography, the intensity reading from the aligner was 20.8 - 24.2 mW/cm$^2$ (Note however that an external photometer reading at 400 nm found an intensity output of 17.2 mW/cm$^2$ when the aligner read 21.0 mW/cm$^2$). 

In general, photolithography procedures should be performed under yellow lighting, as light wavelengths from 320-450 nm can promote reactions in the photoresist used. Aging of photoresist over time can also significantly affect the photolithography process, and therefore all processes should be re-optimised regularly over time to give the desired result [@Microchemicals]. The range in processing times for some steps of the processes used here are largely due to the effects of aging on the photoresist. 

 The step-by-step processes for each resist are detailed in the subsequent sections.

## AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 photoresist

1. Spincoat at a final speed of 4000 rotations per minute (rpm) for 1 minute, with an initial acceleration of 500 rpm/s (notes: clean the substrate with acetone, isopropanol (IPA) and nitrogen before spincoating; use only the minimum amount of photoresist required to fully cover the wafer surface; avoid any gaps or bubbles in the photoresist).

2. Softbake 2-4 minutes at $95^\circ$C on the hotplate (2 min for individual devices, 4 min for a quarter wafer)

3. Mask expose for 10-12 s (note: clean mask with acetone/IPA and N$_2$ dry before use)

4. Develop with 3 parts AZ$^\circledR$ 326 (2.38 % TMAH metal-ion free developer, Microchemicals GmbH) in 1 part deionised (DI) water for 30-45 s (note: rinse for 10-15 s in one development solution, then perform the rest of the development in clean developer for a cleaner profile; lightly agitate the solution throughout the development process)

5. Rinse device for 30 s in DI water to remove excess developer, then dry under nitrogen

## AZ$^\circledR$ nLOF 2020 photoresist

1. Spincoat at final speed of 3000 rotations per minute (rpm) for 1 minute, with an initial acceleration of 500 rpm/s (notes: clean the substrate with acetone, isopropanol (IPA) and nitrogen before spincoating; avoid any gaps or bubbles in the photoresist)

2. Softbake for precisely 60 s at $110^\circ$C on the hotplate

3. Mask expose for 2.7-3 s (note: clean mask with acetone/IPA and N$_2$ dry before use)

4. Post-exposure bake for precisely 60 s at $110^\circ$C on the hotplate to cross-link exposed resist

5. Develop with 3 parts AZ$^\circledR$ 326 in 1 part DI water for 60-70 s (note: rinse for 30 s in one development solution, then perform the rest of the development in clean developer for a cleaner profile; lightly agitate the solution throughout the development process)

6. Rinse device for 30 s in DI water to remove excess developer, then dry under nitrogen

## SU8-2150 photoresist

1. SU-8 was diluted in cyclopentanone until viscosity was low enough to spincoat on substrate and then sonicated at $50^\circ$C for 3-4 hours (Note: The dilution ratio used was ~1 part SU-8 to 5 parts cyclopentanone. However, the age of the SU-8 may mean that significant evaporation had occurred prior to use, and the amount of SU-8 actually present is underrepresented by this ratio)

2. Spincoat first with a final speed of 500 rpm (acceleration 500 rpm/s) for 10 seconds, followed by spincoating at 4000 rpm (acceleration 7500 rpm/s) for 40 s.

3. Softbake for 10 minutes at $95^\circ$C on the hotplate
    
3. Mask expose for 6-8 s (note: clean mask with acetone/IPA and N$_2$ dry before use)

4. Post-exposure bake for 10 minutes at $95^\circ$C on the hotplate to cross-link exposed resist

5. Develop with SU-8 developer (Kayaku Advanced Materials, formerly Microchem) for 10-15 s, then clean in IPA for 30 s, repeat this step once then dry under nitrogen (note: lightly agitate the solution throughout the development process)
