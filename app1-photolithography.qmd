# Photolithography {#sec-photolithography}

This section details some of the standard photolithography procedures used in the device fabrication processes detailed in @sec-fabrication. Photolithography was performed with both positive and negative photoresists (also known as "resists"). Photolithography with the positive resist used here required a single softbake step, while with negative resists a second @Microchem

The nitrogen ($\geq$ 99.99%) and oxygen (99.7%) used in photolithographic work was supplied by BOC Limited New Zealand. Deionised (DI) water was taken from a Synergy$^\circledR$ UV Water Purification System. The DI water had a measured conductivity of $(1.4\pm0.1)\textrm{ } \mu \textrm{S cm}^{-1}$, compared to tap water with a measured conductivity of $(7.8\pm0.2)\textrm{ } \mu \textrm{S cm}^{-1}$.
