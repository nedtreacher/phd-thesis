The quartothesis is adapted from a Masters Thesis used from the Department of Biological Sciences, University of Bergen ([GitHub](https://biostats-r.github.io/biostats/github/index.html)). Various formatting changes have been made to ensure that the thesis template is appropriate for a physics PhD Thesis, including the use of IEEE referencing (ieee.csl). Various .tex file partials have also been added (before_body.tex, biblio.tex) to add an abstract, acknowledgements and ensure the chapter order is correct. R and Python code is run in each chapter independently. 

The thesis is controlled via the \_quarto.yml file. In this file, the following elements can be edited:

-   title (line 5)
-   author (line 6)
-   chapters (line 9) if you add or remove any chapters
-   appendices (line 19) if you add or remove any appendices
-   echo to false to hide code
-   cover figure (line 42)
-   Degree etc (line 50)
-   Description of cover figure (line 64)
