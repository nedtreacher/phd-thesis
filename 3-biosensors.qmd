# Carbon Nanotube and Graphene Field-Effect Transistors as Biosensor Platforms

## Carbon Nanotube Networks & Graphene as Biosensing Transducers {#sec-biosensing-transducers}

As carbon nanotubes and graphene are highly sensitive substances and are easily functionalised with biomaterials, they make an ideal platform for biosensing [@Battie2010; @Ohno2010;  @Benlikaya2019; @Goodwin2021].

## Odorant Receptors {#sec-odorant-receptors}

### General Overview

Vertebrate odorant receptors are part of a group of seven-transmembrane proteins known as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). These ORs undergo a change in conformation in response to binding of a specific volatile compound or to a specific range of VOCs, which leads to activation and dissociation of the G-protein within the cell [@Zhang2021]. This makes them suitable for use as the biological sensing elements in a bioelectronic nose device.

### Artificial Membranes {#sec-artificial-membranes}

Odorant receptors are transmembrane proteins, and therefore require a lipid membrane to preserve their structure. ORs can expressed in cells, where they can be isolated alongside with the native cell membrane, or embedded in an artificial lipid bilayer format that mimics a cell membrane. These artificial membranes include micelles, lipid cubic phases, nanovesicles (including nanoliposomes), and nanodiscs.

Nanodiscs have a particularly high stability compared to other formats as their lipid bilayer is encompassed by a membrane scaffold protein (MSP) [@Nath2007; @Bayburt2010]. The stability of this format means it is frequently used in the fabrication of biosensor devices, which are often described as being particularly reliable and long-lived [@Goldsmith2011; @Yang2018; @Moon2020; @Cheema2021]. Another advantage of nanodiscs is that the MSP can be attached to biosensor surfaces via specific affinity tags, for example, the MSP hexahistidine tag ('his-tag') [@Bayburt2010]. Unlike other artificial membranes, there is also little variation between the size of individual nanodiscs [@Nath2007]. Depending on the type of
MSP used, a nanodisc measures between 10-20 nm across and can hold either a single or several odorant receptors [@Nath2007; @Bayburt2010]. @fig-msp-iOR-nanodisc shows the structure of a nanodisc with contained odorant receptors.

### Sensor Functionalisation

### Sensing Methods {#sec-biosensor-methods}

#### Aqueous Environment {.unnumbered}

#### Vapour Environment {.unnumbered}

Carbon nanotubes have been used for vapour-phase sensing since 2000, when Kong *et al.* found that the resistance over a single CNT channel was modified when exposed to gas molecules like NO$_2$ and NH$_3$ [@Kong2000]. Various groups have gone on to show that carbon nanotube network FET devices can be used effectively in a range of non-specific gas sensing applications [@Battie2011; @Boyd2014; @Chen2019]. Two possible mechanisms have been suggested for the response of pristine carbon nanotubes to various gases. The first involves charge transfer to the CNTs from adsorbed gas molecules, and the other involves modification of the Schottky barrier at contacts between the semi-conducting CNTs and metal electrodes, as well as between semi-conducting and metallic CNTs [@Battie2011; @Boyd2014]. Carbon nanotubes have also been functionalised with a variety of substances and biological materials for particular sensitivity towards a specific compound (papers from Sangar).  

![Real-time responses to 2 ppm eugenol vapour by an mOR174-9 nanodisc-functionalised single-CNT field effect transistor. The response to eugenol on day 69 (red triangles) indicates that the device retains the ability to respond to eugenol 10 weeks after functionalisation [@Goldsmith2011].](figures/ch3/eugenol.png){#fig-eugenol-responses width=60%}

Goldsmith *et al.* have previously demonstrated it is possible to specifically detect eugenol vapour using a single-CNT device functionalised with mOR174-9 odorant receptors in a nanodisc format. In the first study of this kind, the mOR CNT FETs were exposed to nitrogen flow at 50% relative humidity. The resistance across a device gated at $V_g$ = 0 V was measured while a specific concentration of the positive ligand eugenol was added to the constant flow for 100 s, then removed from the flow for 100 s. This cycle was repeated five times. @fig-eugenol-responses shows that significant real-time current increases of up to $\sim$ 9% were observed during each cycle of exposure to eugenol. The device still responded to eugenol cycles after 69 days of storage in 25% (v/v) ethanol at 4°C. This nicely-behaved and persistent activity may result from the long-lived nanodisc format used [@Goldsmith2011]. As far as the author knows, there has been no investigation up until now into whether this behaviour can be replicated for insect odorant receptor devices. It is not clear that iORs can simply be substituted for  mORs for vapour sensing. The reasons for this distinction are made in the subsequent section.   

## Insect Odorant Receptor Biosensors

### *In Vivo* Structure and Function

Insect odorant (or olfactory) receptors (iORs) are a diverse range of odorant-sensitive transmembrane proteins located in dendrite cells of sensory hairs, known as sensilla, on the antennae and maxillary palps of an insect [@Clyne1999; @Wicher2021]. Insects possess a specific set of iORs tailored towards their ecological role (iORx, where the “x” denotes the OR variant), as well as a co-receptor known as “ORCO” (Odorant Receptor Co-Receptor). In the insect, a given iORx is activated by volatile compounds, while the ORCO co-receptor is insensitive to VOCs but couples with iORx to form a heteromeric complex, which activates intracellular signalling via its ion channel activity. *In vivo*, the complex is required for VOC detection and operates as a non-selective cation channel. This channel opens to allow ions to travel across the cell membrane in response to iOR interaction with VOCs [@Smart2008; @Wicher2008; @Sato2008; @Carraher2015; @Butterwick2018 @Wicher2021; @Cheema2021].

iORs were initially thought to be similar in structure to vertebrate odorant receptors, but is now known that iORs have a completely different topology and mechanism to GPCRs, despite also possessing seven-transmembrane domains. Their configuration in the membrane is inverted. Equivalently, the carboxyl group or 'C terminus' of the iOR sits outside the membrane of a cell, and the anime group or 'N terminus' of the iOR sits inside the cell membrane [@Glatz2011; @Butterwick2018; @Carraher2015].

Each odorant receptor of the *Drosophilia melanogaster* sensilla will respond to a variety of odor compound. Odors which provoke a particularly strong response from a specific odorant receptor are referred to in the literature as 'positive ligands' for that receptor [@Murugathas2019b; @Murugathas2020]. The strength of response by a specific OR depends on the compound being detected; furthermore, there may be no response to a compound, or one compound may inhibit the response of the receptor to other compounds. Odor compounds which provoke no response from a particular receptor are referred to as 'negative ligands' for that receptor [@Murugathas2019b; @Murugathas2020]. A comprehensive database that details the various *Drosophilia melanogaster* odorant receptors and their response profile to a range of volatile compounds can be consulted online [@Munch2016].

### Aqueous Sensing

As in the case of vertebrate ORs, recent studies have shown that iORs each interact with a specific VOC or a specific range of VOCs and can also be used in bioelectronic nose applications. However, the sensing mechanisms underlying their use *in vitro* are not currently well-understood [@Murugathas2019b; @Murugathas2020; @Khadka2019]. From further development and examination of iOR-based biosensors, new insights into the mechanisms at play may emerge. Previously, the literature has primarily focused on the operation of iOR-FET biosensors in an aqueous environment. Here, carbon nanotube or graphene FETs have been non-covalently functionalised with insect odorant receptors in either a nanodisc or liposome format. The high surface-to-volume ratio of carbon nanotubes and graphene allow for the odorant receptors to be densely immobilised across the channel surface. The functionalised channel is placed in a liquid-gated environment contained in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and gated with a Ag-AgCl reference electrode (see @sec-gating). Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) is used as the liquid gate electrolyte [@Murugathas2019b; @Murugathas2020]. A small amount of DMSO is also added to the electrolyte, a dipolar solvent which is widely used to solubilise poorly soluble analytes in a biological setting [@Galvao2014].

:::

Functionalisation of a FET device channel with iORs significantly alters the transfer characteristics of that channel. Murugathas *et al.* found that successful functionalisation of a CNTFET device with iORs would typically increase the device on-current, increase its on-off ratio and cause a significant negative shift in threshold voltage, as shown in @fig-functionalisation-literature (a) [@Murugathas2019b]. Meanwhile, successful functionalisation of a graphene device with iORs would typically dramatically decrease the device on-current and cause a negative shift in Dirac voltage, as seen in @fig-functionalisation-literature (b) [@Murugathas2020]. These changes are not simply the result of linker attachment to the channel surface [@Murugathas2019b]. It is thought that the negative shift of both threshold and Dirac voltages are caused by the N-terminus amine groups on the odorant receptors or amine groups on the nanodisc membrane scaffold proteins donating electrons to the device channel, which has a similar effect to doping the channel with impurities [@Bradley2004; @Murugathas2019b; @Murugathas2020]. Note that very similar changes occur when functionalising with empty nanodiscs which contain no odorant receptors, shown in @fig-functionalisation-literature (c) and @fig-functionalisation-literature (d). Unless the odorant receptors attach preferentially to the network over nanodiscs, it appears the gating effect is predominantly due to the large-scale attachment of nanodisc membranes.

The response curves show the cumulative responses of OR22a-functionalised devices to both the positive ligand methyl hexanoate (green) and negative ligand *trans*-2-hexan-1-al (black). They also show the cumulative response of a empty nanodisc functionalised device to methyl hexanoate (purple) [@Murugathas2019b; @Murugathas2020].
:::

Interactions between iORs attached to the channel, such as OR22a, and positive ligands added to the electrolyte environment, such as methyl hexanoate (MeHex), can alter the current flowing through the channel. These current changes can be monitored over time and interpreted as real-time sensor responses. @fig-iOR-sensing-literature (a) and (b) show the respective responses of the OR22a-functionalised CNT FET and graphene FET in @fig-functionalisation-literature to methyl hexanoate in real-time. This result demonstrates that iOR-FETs are sensitive down to the femtomolar scale in an aqueous environment. @fig-iOR-sensing-literature (c) and (d) compare the average methyl hexanoate responses of multiple devices to that of relevant controls. It was verified that the OR22a-functionalised devices would not respond to *trans*-2-hexan-1-al, the negative ligand for OR22a; it was also verified that empty nanodiscs would not respond non-selectively to the positive ligand [@Murugathas2019b; @Murugathas2020]. 

#### Sensing Mechanisms {.unnumbered}

The reduction in the channel current of a functionalised FET upon exposure to a positive ligand is notably different to the signal transduction mechanism of iORs *in vivo*, since ORCO does not appear to be required for an iOR bioelectronic nose to function. It has been proposed that the signal response results from the positive ligand binding to the iOR protein, causing it to change shape. Cheema *et al.* used neutron reflectometry to demonstrate that OR22a nanodiscs undergo a 1 nm height change after ethyl hexanoate exposure, likely resulting from a structural change [@Cheema2021]. This change most likely affects the channel in one of two ways. The first involves transfer of charge from the iOR to the channel, reducing I$_{d}$ and causing a negative threshold voltage (or Dirac point) shift. Another could be a more indirect electrostatic gating effect, due to the movement of charge within the Debye screening length of the channel. The Debye length of $1 \times$ PBS buffer is typically much shorter than the height of a single nanodisc [@Murugathas2019b]. However, if structural changes in the iOR were primarily occurring at its base, it is still possible that the electrostatic gating could be the primary sensing mechanism.
