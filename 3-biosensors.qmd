# Odorant Receptor Biosensors with Carbon Nanotube Network and Graphene Transistors {#sec-iOR-sensors}

## Introduction {#sec-biosensing-transducers}

In @sec-thin-film-transistors, it was established that as carbon nanotubes and graphene are highly sensitive and are easily modified with biomaterials, they make an ideal platform for biosensing [@Kauffman2008; @Ohno2010]. In the early 2000s, it was established that sensitive and selective biosensors could be created by modifying a carbon nanotube field-effect transistor channel with protein receptors [@Chen2003; @Kauffman2008]. In the following two decades, a wide range of other biological receptors have been attached to carbon nanotube FETs and graphene FETs for the creation of biosensors, including enzymes [@Lee2009; @Zhang2015a; @Dudina2019], antibodies [@Kim2008; @Jin2015; @Tsang2019] and aptameric DNA [@Maehashi2007; @Gao2016; @Nguyen2021]. These miniaturised 'lab on a chip' devices are of particular interest due to their low cost, rapid use time, simple operation and small size compared with more traditional biological analysis methods [@Kauffman2008]. It is hoped that such sensors could be deployed outside the laboratory in a range of front-line settings requiring rapid and reliable detection [@Dung2018; @Yang2018; @Kim2022a]. Specific examples include rapid diagnostic testing at a busy medical clinic [@Lim2014], or the mass detection of biological threats across a large shipment of imported fruit [@B3; @Queensland].

Rapid developments in this biosensor technology and parallel developments in the understanding of animal olfaction led to these transistors being used in bioelectronic nose applications from the late 2000s onwards [@Yoon2009; @Jin2012; @Lee2012b; @Park2012]. 'Bioelectronic nose' is a general term dating back to 1961, which refers to the use of an biologically-modified electronic array to detect specific odor traces in a highly selective and sensitive manner. As the name suggests, the signals from this system mimic the electrochemical signals received by olfactory neurons in an animal nose [@Kwon2015; @Dung2018; @Goodwin2021]. A biomimetic approach to bioelectronic nose development couples the CNT FET or GFET signal-amplifying transducer element with sensitive components of the animal olfactory system. These components include olfactory cells [@Wang2007], odorant binding proteins (OBPs) [@Larisika2015; @Kotlowski2018] and odorant receptor proteins (olfactory receptors, ORs) [@Yang2018; @Murugathas2020]. An animal nose can detect volatile odors in the air at low parts-per-trillion concentrations, performance which is far superior to even the best available gas sensor technology. The aim for novel olfactory-based biosensors is to match or surpass this level of accuracy [@Kwon2015; @Dung2018; @Kim2022a].

## Odorant Receptors {#sec-odorant-receptors}

### *In vivo* Structure and Function

Odorant receptors (ORs) are an essential part of the olfactory systems of most animals, including humans. Vertebrate odorant receptors are part of a group of seven-transmembrane proteins known as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). These transmembrane proteins are terminated with an amine group outside the cell membrane, known as the N-terminus, and terminated with a carboxyl group inside the cell membrane, known as the C-terminus [@Glatz2011]. In an animal nose, odorant receptors are found on the membrane of olfactory cells. Volatile compounds entering the nose selectively bind to specific  odorant receptors, which undergo a change in conformation [@Dung2018; @Kim2022a]. Some odorant receptors are activated by only a few target compounds, while others respond to many; subtle differences in amino acid composition determine the range of compounds which activate a specific OR [@Yang2018; @Goodwin2021]. The binding process leads to activation and dissociation of the G-protein within the olfactory cell [@Buck1991; @Zhang2021]. Intracellular signalling events triggered by G-protein dissociation are converted to an action potential which is transmitted through neuronal pathways to the brain. The multidimensional combination of receptors activated is then interpreted as a specific odor [@Buck1991; @Kwon2015; @Dung2018; @Kim2022a]. ORs let us distinguish between thousands of odors [@Buck1991; @Dung2018; @Yang2018; @Kim2022a].

### Artificial Membranes {#sec-artificial-membranes}

Odorant receptors are transmembrane proteins, which are insoluble and tend to aggregate and oligomerise in solution [@Nath2007]. They therefore require stabilisation from  either a specific detergent environment or a membrane layer to preserve their structure and function when solubilised [@Fruh2011; @Dung2018]. Odorant receptors can be expressed and isolated using heterologous cell systems, where a host cell replicates a protein from transfected RNA or DNA material [@Glatz2011; @Dung2018]. The most commonly used expression cells are human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells [@Lim2014; @Ahn2020], *E. Coli* bacteria [@Yang2017; @Yang2018] and *S. cerevisiae* (baker's yeast) [@Bohbot2020]. The cell membrane can then be used directly in a sensor [@Dung2018]. Alternatively, odorant receptors can be embedded in an artificial lipid membrane format that mimics the native cell membrane [@Nath2007]. These membranes can be produced in large numbers and remain in storage for much longer than live cells [@Goldsmith2011; @Lim2015]. Lipid membranes are constructed from phospholipid molecules, which comprise of a small, hydrophilic, polar 'head' and long, hydrophobic, non-polar 'tail' [@Bose2021; @Ramadon2022]. These artificial membranes include nanomicelles, nanovesicles (including liposomes), lipid cubic phases, amphipols, and nanodiscs [@Fruh2011; @Yang2018]. The small size of these artificial membranes makes them appropriate for use with nanomaterial-based transducers [@Lim2015; @Dung2018].

The polar, hydrophilic 'heads' and non-polar, hydrophobic 'tails' of the component phospholipids are indicated. Adapted from [@Micelle].](figures/ch3/OSC_Microbio_07_03_micelle_edit.png){#fig-micelle width=55%}

A nanovesicle is a nanoscopic spherical bilayer fluid sac. There are various types of artificial nanovesicles, including liposomes, ethosomes, transfersomes, niosomes and phytosomes. The type of nanovesicle depends on its chemical makeup [@Ramadon2022]. For example, a liposome is made up of phospholipid and cholesterol, and can consist of one or more concentric amphiphilic bilayers. The liposome can contain hydrophobic compounds within the bilayer due to hydrophobic interactions, while hydrophilic compounds are held within the vesicle core or interior [@Nath2007; @Ramadon2022]. A nanovesicle can be used solely as a format to protect membrane proteins [@Murugathas2020], or with the addition of integrated ion channels can mimic the operation of a cell *in vivo*, with intracellular signalling pathways triggered by the membrane proteins [@Lim2015]. Nanomicelles (or simply micelles) are also nanoscopic and spherical, but unlike nanovesicles have no inner fluid sac [@Nath2007; @Bose2021]. Micelles self-assemble when phospholipid is mixed with detergent. The surface of the micelle is made up of the hydrophilic detergent and phospholipid heads, while the internal core is made up of the hydrophobic phospholipid tail [@Nath2007]. Hydrophobic compounds can be contained within the core of the micelle [@Bose2021]. @fig-micelle illustrates the difference between the liposome and micelle structures.

Nanodiscs have emerged as a model membrane candidate which has many advantages over the more traditional nanovesicle and micelle formats. The nanodisc is a disc-shaped lipid bilayer encompassed by an membrane scaffold protein (MSP) [@Nath2007; @Bayburt2010; @Yang2018]. The amphiphilic membrane scaffold protein protects the exposed, strongly hydrophobic side chains of the nanodisc in an aqueous environment [@Fruh2011; @Yang2018]. Unlike liposomes and micelles, there is little variation between the size of individual nanodiscs due to constraints placed on the bilayer by the encompassing scaffold protein used, meaning greater consistency within and between membrane batches [@Nath2007; @Fruh2011]. Nanodiscs have also been found to be significantly less prone to non-specific binding (see @sec-non-specific-binding) than micelles [@Fruh2011]. Another advantage of nanodiscs is that the membrane scaffold protein can be attached to biosensor surfaces at specific affinity tags, for example, the scaffold protein hexahistidine tag ('his-tag') [@Bayburt2010; @Fruh2011]. Depending on the type of MSP used, a nanodisc measures between 10-20 nm across and can hold either a single or several odorant receptors [@Nath2007; @Bayburt2010]. The protein coating of the nanodisc makes it particularly stable. The stability of nanodiscs means they can be used to produce particularly reliable and long-lived biosensor devices [@Goldsmith2011; @Yang2018; @Moon2020; @Cheema2021].

## Odorant Receptor Carbon Nanotube and Graphene Biosensors

### Sensor Functionalisation {#sec-sensor-types}

For a bioelectronic nose to operate, sufficient coupling must exist between the bioreceptor element and the sensor transducer. Odorant receptors can be directly attached by physical adsorption; however, this approach is difficult to control, and can result in weak coupling between the odorant receptors and the transducer [@Kwon2015; @Dung2018]. Alternatively, a bifunctional linker element may mediate the attachment between functional groups of the bioreceptor and the carbon-ring surface of the transducer in a biochemical process referred to as functionalisation [@Star2003a]. In this thesis, the amino functional group is of particular interest, but there are many other nucleophilic functional groups available for binding, including carboxyls, hydroxyls, thiols/sulfhydryls, phenols, imidazoles and so on [@Fruh2011; @Dung2018]. The linker chemical interacts with the transducer either through stronger covalent bonding or weaker non-covalent bonding. The relative advantages and disadvantages of each type of receptor immobilisation can be found in @tbl-functionalisation-types, while a more thorough comparison of covalent and non-covalent linker functionalisation can be found in @sec-noncovalent-functionalisation.

@tbl-or-biosensors summarises all published odorant-receptor functionalised carbon nanotube and graphene field-effect transistor-based sensors to date. The majority of published works on this topic come from the Tai Hyun Park group at Seoul National University. The Park group has mainly focused on CNT FETs functionalised with human odorant receptors, but has used a range of different covalent and non-covalent functionalisation techniques when producing the sensors. Three functionalisation methods have been used by both the Park group as well as by a secondary research group: non-covalent glutaraldehyde (GA)-conjugated 1,5-diaminonaphthalene (DAN) functionalisation [@Kwon2015; @Goodwin2021], non-covalent 1-pyrenebutanoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (PBASE) functionalisation [@Murugathas2020; @Yoo2022], and covalent nickel/nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) modified diazonium salt [@Goldsmith2011; @Son2017]. Interestingly, no single paper compares multiple possible functionalisation techniques directly, making it difficult to assess the quality of various attachment methods. The limit of detection (LOD) could be used as a rough measure of quality. The functionalisation procedure resulting in the lowest limit of detection used was non-covalent [@Park2012], though other functionalisation techniques used appear to have more consistent LOD. Furthermore, non-covalent functionalisation of odorant receptors has never been used for vapour sensing. The next section further explores the sensing behaviour of biosensors functionalised following the most commonly-used protocols.

:::

Nanovesicle-based odorant receptor biosensors can be used to directly mimic the natural behaviour of an odorant receptor, where the presence of analyte leads to a flow of ions into an olfactory cell [@Lim2015; @Dung2018]. Lim *et al.* functionalised a carbon nanotube field-effect transistor with nanovesicles featuring a human odorant receptor hOR2AG1 covalently coupled with a potassium ion channel at the intracellular C-terminus, as well as an endogenous calcium ion channel, as shown in @fig-lim-ion-channel (a). These nanovesicles were attached to the random carbon nanotube network through a charge-charge interaction with poly-D-lysine, demonstrated with the atomic force microscope image shown in @fig-lim-ion-channel (b). Binding of amyl butyrate to hOR2AG1 causes the OR to change conformation, opening the coupled potassium ion channel and gating the transistor channel. The real-time signal responses associated with amyl butyrate binding are shown by the red trace in @fig-lim-ion-channel (c). Intracellular signalling by the odorant receptors means that target binding also opens the calcium ion channel, and responses are therefore seen when just calcium ions are present. However, without potassium or calcium ions present, ion inflow cannot occur and no conductance change occurs. @fig-lim-ion-channel (d) shows the relative response size to amyl butyrate with different ions available [@Lim2015].

:::

Odorant receptors can also be expressed in the native cell membrane and attached directly to the biosensor channel. Here, the changes in odorant receptor conformation that result from analyte binding cause affects the distance between charges on the odorant receptor and the transducer channel, gating the channel [@Kwon2015; @Dung2018]. Kwon *et al.* functionalised graphene field-effect transistors with human odorant receptors hOR2AG1 and hOR3A1 using non-covalently attached 1,5-diaminonaphthalene (DAN) modified with glutaraldehyde as a linker, as shown in @fig-kwon-multiplexed (a). The odorant receptors attach to the GA-modified DAN via a Schiff-base reaction [@Subasi2022]. OR attachment was demonstrated by SEM imaging as well as a significant change in device resistance, shown in @fig-kwon-multiplexed (b). Both hOR2AG1 and hOR3A1 showed real-time responses to their corresponding target analyte at sub-femtomolar concentrations, as shown in @fig-kwon-multiplexed (c) and @fig-kwon-multiplexed (d) respectively. No responses were seen from linker-modified graphene to similar analyte concentrations. The dose-dependent response curve of both these odorant receptor sensors is shown in @fig-kwon-multiplexed (e). As in @fig-lim-ion-channel (d), a Langmuir-type dose response behaviour was seen, where a logarithmic increase in signal response is observed for sub-femtomolar or femtomolar concentration analyte additions, which gives way to saturation behaviour with picomolar additions.

:::

Biosensors have also been produced where odorant receptors are held in a detergent micelle format instead of the native cell membrane. The mechanism behind sensing here is the same as for odorant receptors in the cell membrane, where a conformational change in the odorant receptors leads to channel gating [@Dung2018; @Yoo2022].

The response to eugenol on day 69 (red triangles) indicates that the device retains the ability to respond to eugenol 10 weeks after functionalisation. Reproduced with permission from [@Goldsmith2011].
:::

Goldsmith *et al.* have previously demonstrated it is possible to specifically detect eugenol vapour using a single-CNT device functionalised with mOR174-9 odorant receptors in either a surfactant (digitonin) or nanodisc format. In the first study of this kind, the mOR CNT FETs were exposed to nitrogen flow at 50% relative humidity. The resistance across a device gated at $V_g$ = 0 V was measured while a specific concentration of the positive ligand eugenol was added to the constant flow for 100 s, then removed from the flow for 100 s. This cycle was repeated five times. @fig-eugenol-responses (a) shows that significant real-time current increases of up to $\sim$ 9% were observed during each cycle of exposure to eugenol. The device still responded to eugenol cycles after 69 days of storage in 25% (v/v) ethanol at 4°C. This nicely-behaved and persistent activity may result from the long-lived nanodisc format used [@Goldsmith2011]. As far as the author knows, there has been no investigation up until now into whether this behaviour can be replicated for insect odorant receptor devices. It is not clear that iORs can simply be substituted for  mORs for vapour sensing. The reasons for this distinction are made in the subsequent section.   

## Insect Odorant Receptor Biosensors

### *In Vivo* Structure and Function

![The tuning OR and odorant receptor coreceptor (ORCO) on the native cell membrane, with C-terminus and N-terminus indicated. The red arrow indicates the location of ion transport across the membrane. Adapted from [@Wicher2008; @Brito2016].](figures/ch3/OR_diagram.png){#fig-iOR-membrane width=60%}

Insect odorant (or olfactory) receptors (iORs) are a diverse range of odorant-sensitive transmembrane proteins located in dendrite cells of sensory hairs, known as sensilla, on the antennae and maxillary palps of an insect [@Clyne1999; @Wicher2021]. Insects possess a specific set of iORs tailored towards their ecological role (iORx, where the “x” denotes the OR variant), as well as a co-receptor known as “ORCO” (Odorant Receptor Co-Receptor). In the insect, a given iORx is activated by volatile compounds, while the ORCO co-receptor is insensitive to VOCs but couples with iORx to form a heteromeric complex, which activates intracellular signalling via its ion channel activity. *In vivo*, the complex is required for VOC detection and operates as a non-selective cation channel. This channel opens to allow ions to travel across the cell membrane in response to iOR interaction with VOCs [@Smart2008; @Wicher2008; @Sato2008; @Carraher2015; @Butterwick2018; @Wicher2021; @Cheema2021]. 

iORs were initially thought to be similar in structure to vertebrate odorant receptors, but is now known that iORs have a completely different topology and mechanism to GPCRs, despite also possessing seven-transmembrane domains. Their configuration in the membrane is inverted. Equivalently, the carboxyl group or 'C terminus' of the iOR sits outside the membrane of a cell, and the amine group or 'N terminus' of the iOR sits inside the cell membrane [@Glatz2011; @Butterwick2018; @Carraher2015]. The *in vivo* configuration of the odorant receptor on the cell membrane is illustrated in @fig-iOR-membrane. 

Each odorant receptor of the *Drosophilia melanogaster* sensilla will respond to a variety of odor compound. Odors which provoke a particularly strong response from a specific odorant receptor are referred to in the literature as 'positive ligands' for that receptor [@Murugathas2019a; @Murugathas2020]. The strength of response by a specific OR depends on the compound being detected; furthermore, there may be no response to a compound, or one compound may inhibit the response of the receptor to other compounds. Odor compounds which provoke no response from a particular receptor are referred to as 'negative ligands' for that receptor [@Murugathas2019a; @Murugathas2020]. A comprehensive database that details the various *Drosophilia melanogaster* odorant receptors and their response profile to a range of volatile compounds can be consulted online [@Munch2016].

### Sensing Behaviour

As in the case of vertebrate ORs, recent studies have shown that iORs each interact with a specific VOC or a specific range of VOCs and can also be used in bioelectronic nose applications. However, the sensing mechanisms underlying their use *in vitro* are not currently well-understood [@Murugathas2019a; @Murugathas2020; @Khadka2019]. From further development and examination of iOR-based biosensors, new insights into the mechanisms at play may emerge. Previously, the literature has primarily focused on the operation of iOR-FET biosensors in an aqueous environment. Here, carbon nanotube or graphene FETs have been non-covalently functionalised with insect odorant receptors in either a nanodisc or liposome format. The high surface-to-volume ratio of carbon nanotubes and graphene allow for the odorant receptors to be densely immobilised across the channel surface. The functionalised channel is placed in a liquid-gated environment contained in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and gated with a Ag-AgCl reference electrode (see @sec-gating). Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) is used as the liquid gate electrolyte [@Murugathas2019a; @Murugathas2020]. A small amount of DMSO is also added to the electrolyte, a dipolar solvent which is widely used to solubilise poorly soluble analytes in a biological setting [@Galvao2014].

:::

Functionalisation of a FET device channel with iORs significantly alters the transfer characteristics of that channel. Murugathas *et al.* found that successful functionalisation of a CNTFET device with iORs would typically increase the device on-current, increase its on-off ratio and cause a significant negative shift in threshold voltage, as shown in @fig-functionalisation-literature (a) [@Murugathas2019a]. Meanwhile, successful functionalisation of a graphene device with iORs would typically dramatically decrease the device on-current and cause a negative shift in Dirac voltage, as seen in @fig-functionalisation-literature (b) [@Murugathas2020]. These changes are not simply the result of linker attachment to the channel surface [@Murugathas2019a]. It is thought that the negative shift of both threshold and Dirac voltages are caused by the N-terminus amine groups on the odorant receptors or amine groups on the nanodisc membrane scaffold proteins donating electrons to the device channel, which has a similar effect to doping the channel with impurities [@Bradley2004; @Murugathas2019a; @Murugathas2020]. Note that very similar changes occur when functionalising with empty nanodiscs which contain no odorant receptors, shown in @fig-functionalisation-literature (c) and @fig-functionalisation-literature (d). Unless the odorant receptors attach preferentially to the network over nanodiscs, it appears the gating effect is predominantly due to the large-scale attachment of nanodisc membranes.

Real-time responses to concentrations of methyl hexanoate in $1 \times$ phosphate buffer saline (PBS) with 1% v/v DMSO by (a) an OR22a nanodisc-functionalised CNT network FET and (b) an OR22a nanodisc-functionalised graphene FET, alongside the normalised signal response curves corresponding to (c) CNT network FETs and (d) graphene FETs. The response curves show the cumulative responses of OR22a-functionalised devices to both the positive ligand methyl hexanoate (green) and negative ligand *trans*-2-hexan-1-al (black). They also show the cumulative response of a empty nanodisc functionalised device to methyl hexanoate (purple). Reproduced with permission from [@Murugathas2019a; @Murugathas2020].

Interactions between iORs attached to the channel, such as OR22a, and positive ligands added to the electrolyte environment, such as methyl hexanoate (MeHex), can alter the current flowing through the channel. These current changes can be monitored over time and interpreted as real-time sensor responses. @fig-iOR-sensing-literature (a) and (b) show the respective responses of the OR22a-functionalised CNT FET and graphene FET in @fig-functionalisation-literature to methyl hexanoate in real-time. This result demonstrates that iOR-FETs are sensitive down to the femtomolar scale in an aqueous environment. @fig-iOR-sensing-literature (c) and (d) compare the average methyl hexanoate responses of multiple devices to that of relevant controls. It was verified that the OR22a-functionalised devices would not respond to *trans*-2-hexan-1-al, the negative ligand for OR22a; it was also verified that empty nanodiscs would not respond non-selectively to the positive ligand [@Murugathas2019a; @Murugathas2020]. 

The reduction in the channel current of a functionalised FET upon exposure to a positive ligand is notably different to the signal transduction mechanism of iORs *in vivo*, since ORCO does not appear to be required for an iOR bioelectronic nose to function. It has been proposed that the signal response results from the positive ligand binding to the iOR protein, causing it to change shape. Cheema *et al.* used neutron reflectometry to demonstrate that OR22a nanodiscs undergo a 1 nm height change after ethyl hexanoate exposure, likely resulting from a structural change [@Cheema2021]. This change most likely affects the channel in one of two ways. The first involves transfer of charge from the iOR to the channel, reducing I$_{d}$ and causing a negative threshold voltage (or Dirac point) shift. Another could be a more indirect electrostatic gating effect, due to the movement of charge within the Debye screening length of the channel. The Debye length of $1 \times$ PBS buffer is typically much shorter than the height of a single nanodisc [@Murugathas2019a]. However, if structural changes in the iOR were primarily occurring at its base, it is still possible that the electrostatic gating could be the primary sensing mechanism.

##	Non-Specific Binding {#sec-non-specific-binding}

Non-specific binding (NSB) refers to any attachment to the sensor channel not related to the specific analyte of interest which could interfere with sensing. Liquid-gated graphene and carbon nanotube devices are highly sensitive to the approach of charge within the Debye length of the device channel [@Shkodra2021]. Non-specific adsorption of the analyte or ambient contamination from numerous elements used in fabricating the biosensor can lead to signal responses not attributable to the mechanism of interest (see @sec-CNT-sensing-mechanisms), leading to false positives when sensing [@Star2003a; @Chen2004; @Fruh2011; @Shkodra2021]. Non-specific adsorption can occur on the channel as well as the the source-drain and gate electrodes [@Chen2004]. A variety of measures can be taken to prevent NSB from occurring. Once bioreceptors have been attached to the channel, remaining exposed carbon nanotubes can be passivated with chemical coatings such as Tween-20 [@Chen2004], PEG [@Star2003a; @Lee2012b], and ethanolamine [@Maehashi2007; @Das2011]. If measuring multiple channels in a multiplexed array, one channel can be left uncoated to compare the sensing response in a process known as 'internal referencing' [@Shkodra2021].

Non-specific binding is particularly significant for protein-functionalised devices. Proteins may be spontaneously adsorbed onto carbon nanotube or graphene surfaces during functionalisation in a manner which is not linker-mediated [@Bradley2004; @Star2003a; @Chen2004]. Non-covalently bound proteins may also detach and reattach to available surfaces in a non-specific manner when exposed to a high ionic strength electrolyte post-functionalisation [@Dung2018]. Such adsorption is known to reduce the conductance of device channels containing semiconducting carbon nanotubes, which may result from electron transfer between amino acid residues and the nanotube network. The significance of this effect is increased when electrodes are not sufficiently passivated or encapsulated due to modulation of the Schottky barrier at the metal-carbon nanotube interface [@Chen2004].
