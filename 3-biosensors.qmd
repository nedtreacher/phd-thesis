# Carbon Nanotube and Graphene Field-Effect Transistors as Biosensor Platforms

## Carbon Nanotube Networks & Graphene as Biosensing Transducers {#sec-biosensing-transducers}

As carbon nanotubes and graphene are highly sensitive substances and are easily functionalised with biomaterials, they make an ideal platform for biosensing \cite{battie_evaluation_2010, benlikaya_ascertaining_2019, ohno_chemical_2010,goodwin_graphene_2021}.
