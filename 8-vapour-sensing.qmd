First year report:
"""First, a 200 sccm flow of N2 gas was sent through the dilution line to the device chamber until 1000 s. Then, the flow controller three-way valves were manually adjusted so that the same 200 sccm flow was directed through 50 mL of EtOH analyte in the carrier line. This continued until 2200 s, where the valves were again manually adjusted so that 200 sccm clean N2 again flowed through the device chamber. The resulting current across the device channel was monitored over this time, and is shown in Figure 19. A response to EtOH exposure and removal is visible."""
