# Carbon Nanotube and Graphene Field-Effect Transistors

## Introduction

Out of a wide range of available transducer options available for the creation of compact, portable and highly-integrated biosensors, field-effect transistors are among the most promising. Field-effect transistors, initially proposed in the 1930s, consist of two conductive electrodes on either side of a semiconducting channel, the 'source' and 'drain' electrodes, alongside an isolated 'gate' electrode which is typically perpendicular to the channel. An applied electric field from the gate electrode capacitively controls channel resistance, giving rise to the label 'field-effect'. By adjusting gate voltage, the flow of charge carriers between source and drain can be varied over several orders of magnitude. The ability of this simple structure to obtain a large signal response from small changes in channel behaviour means field-effect transistors can be used as high-quality amplifiers for sensor applications [@Petti2016; @Tran2016; @Shkodra2021; @Yao2021]. Generally, field-effect transistors are unipolar transistors; channel conduction either mainly consists of electron carriers, or hole carriers, depending on the electrode and channel materials used [@Yao2021].

Carbon nanotube network and graphene field-effect transistors (CNTFETs and GFETs) are both examples of a class of field-effect transistors called thin-film transistors (TFTs). These transistors, first developed in 1962 [@Weimer1962], are closely related to the commonly-used metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET). Unlike MOSFETs, thin-film transistors do not use the substrate as the device channel. Instead, current passes through a semiconducting film on the surface of the device; the films discussed here are graphene and carbon nanotubes, two carbon-based low-dimension nanomaterials. Since thin-film transistors do not require a conductive substrate, they can be fabricated using light, flexible and stretchable substrates, making them significantly more versatile than MOSFETs [@Cao2009; @Petti2016; @Shkodra2021]. Invisible conductive thin-films such as metal oxides and carbon nanotube networks can also be used to create transparent electronics [@Cao2009]. While the principle of modulating current with a gate electrode is shared by the MOSFET and TFT, the underlying physics behind the transistor behaviour differs between the two. The MOSFET is turned on by the change in carrier behaviour when switching from an depletion to an inversion mode, while this is not the case for a TFT [@Petti2016]. Details of graphene and carbon nanotube TFT switching behaviours can be found in the subsequent sections.

## Thin-Film Field-Effect Transistors {#sec-general-FETs}

### Structure and Gating {#sec-gating}

The basic components of the thin-film transistor can be configured in a number of different ways. Two of these configurations are the back-gated field-effect transistor and the liquid-gated (or electrolyte-gated) transistor. The relatively simple back-gated configuration, shown in @fig-gating-schematics (a), uses the degenerately doped silicon substrate as the gate. The channel is isolated from the gate with a thin silicon dioxide layer. A liquid-gated device, shown in @fig-gating-schematics (b), is used for sensitive analyte detection in liquid-phase. In the most common form of this configuration, a submerged Ag/AgCl reference electrode is used as a top-gate. The channel is isolated from the gate by the bulk of an electrolyte solution, typically the biofriendly phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Other aqueous salt solutions, polymers and ion-gels are also sometimes used as the electrolyte gate. The electrolyte is restricted to the channel area using a hydrophobic PDMS microchamber, referred to here as a 'PDMS well' [@Avouris2007; @Shkodra2021; @Tran2016; @Li2023].

Two different voltages are used to adjust transistor operation. The first is the 'drain bias', $V_{ds}$, between the drain and source electrodes, and the second is the 'gate bias', $V_g$, applied between the gate and source electrode. The value of $V_g$ determines how charge carriers flow under the influence of $V_{ds}$ to produce a drain-source current $I_d$. The relative effect of changes in $V_g$ on source-drain current $I_d$ is determined by gate capacitance, which is a series combination of the geometric capacitance, $C_{G}$, and the quantum capacitance of the channel nanomaterial, $C_{Q}$ [@Avouris2007; @Cao2009; @Heller2009a; @Tran2016; @Li2023]. For a back-gated device, geometric capacitance is predominantly due to the oxide layer capacitance $C_{ox}$ [@Li2023]. In an ambipolar transistor, a highly negative $V_g$ will give rise to hole conduction, and a highly positive $V_g$ will give rise to electron conduction[@Avouris2007; @Yao2021; @Li2023]. When $|V_{ds}| < |V_g| - |V_t|$ and the device is gated on, the device is in the linear regime. In this regime, $V_{ds}$ is directly proportional to $I_{d}$, similar to an Ohmic resistor. When $|V_{ds}| > |V_g| - |V_t|$ and the device is on, the device is in the saturation regime, where the relationship between $V_{ds}$ and $I_{d}$ becomes non-linear [@Petti2016; @Shkodra2021].

#### Liquid-Gating and Debye Length {.unnumbered}

![A diagram of the formation of an electric double layer (EDL) under an applied voltage between source and liquid-gate electrodes, with a $p$-type semiconductor used for the channel thin-film. Electric double layers are present at both the gate-electrolyte interface and semiconductor-electrolyte interface. Adapted from [@Ohno2015; @Shkodra2021; @Tiwari2022].](figures/ch2/Debye-length-schematic.png){#fig-Debye-length width="60%"}

Understanding the ionic behaviour of the gate electrolyte used in a liquid-gated device setup gives insight into the gating and sensing behaviour of the setup. When a voltage is applied at the liquid-gate, the charged ions in solution move to form two electric double layers, one at the interface between the electrolyte and gate electrode, and one at the interface between electrolyte and semiconducting channel, as shown in @fig-Debye-length. The gate capacitance is a series combination of the capacitance of each EDL in series with quantum capacitance $C_{Q}$ [@Heller2010; @Shkodra2021]. The Gouy-Chapman-Stern model splits the EDL into two distinct regions, the first being a compact layer of ions, the Stern layer, and the second being a more diffuse layer, the Gouy-Chapman layer [@Tiwari2022]. The surface potential of the solid-electrolyte interface exponentially decreases across the diffuse region of the double-layer; the characteristic length of this potential screening is known as Debye length, $\lambda_D$. The typical electrolyte Debye length is on a nanometer scale, therefore the bulk electrolyte acts as an insulator, similar to the silicon dioxide dielectric in the back-gated configuration. The Stern layer capacitance is inversely proportional to the Debye length, and therefore decreased $\lambda_D$ corresponds to increased gate capacitance [@Heller2010; @Ohno2015; @Shkodra2021; @Yao2021].

$$
\lambda_D = \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_0\epsilon_rk_bT}{2N_Aq^2I}}
$$ {#eq-debye-length}

The equation for Debye length $\lambda_D$ in an electrolyte solution is given by @eq-debye-length, where $\epsilon_0$ is vacuum permittivity, $\epsilon_r$ is the relative permittivity of the electrolyte, $\k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is absolute temperature in K, $N_A$ is the Avogadro number, $q$ is the elementary charge and $I$ is ionic strength in mmol L$^{-1}$. When temperature is kept constant, $\lambda_D$ only depends on the ionic strength of the electrolyte and not on any attributes of the gate electrode or channel. Successive dilutions of a particular electrolyte will increase the Debye length: for $1 \times$ PBS, $\lambda_D$ is 0.7 nm, for $0.1 \times$ PBS, $\lambda_D$ is 2.3 nm, for $0.01 \times$ PBS $\lambda_D$ is 7.3 nm and so on. This means gate capacitance is directly dependent on the electrolyte used and its concentration. A $1 \times$ PBS electrolyte gives a gate capacitance several orders of magnitude larger than that of a silicon oxide back-gate. A larger capacitance significantly increases the effect of electrostatic gating on the channel current, often described as increased electrostatic coupling between gate and channel. A liquid-gated device with low Debye length will therefore be highly sensitive to electrostatic changes across a small voltage range [@Heller2010; @Wang2010; @Ohno2015; @Shkodra2021; @Yao2021]. 

However, a decreased Debye length also has disadvantages for sensing. Electrostatic potentials outside of the electrolyte-channel electrical double layer are effectively screened from the channel. Electrical double layers will also form around charged biomolecules such as DNA present within the solution. The combined screening effect means signals due to potential changes in charged biomolecules within the bulk electrolyte will have no effect on gating of the channel, and therefore no effect on $I_d$. Interactions between the analyte and any biorecognition element must therefore occur within the Debye length, and so a tradeoff exists between channel sensitivity and the size of the sensitive region above the channel. Many medium or large proteins will require a relatively dilute electrolyte for analyte capture to be detected by the channel, which may not reflect the intended environment for biosensor application [@Stern2007; @Piccinini2018; @Shkodra2021]. Other approaches to increasing Debye length without reducing device sensitivity have therefore also been trialled. One approach involves attaching a layer of polyethylene glycol polymer (PEG) to the channel, limiting the approach of counterions. This increases Debye length at the electrolyte-channel interface while preserving the capacitance of the electrolyte-gate interface, keeping device sensitivity relatively high [@Gao2016; @Kesler2020].

### Electrical Characterisation

Both carbon nanotube field effect transistors and graphene field-effect transistors are naturally ambipolar. Applying a gate voltage $V_g$ to the gate of an ambipolar thin-film transistor influences the amount and type of available charge carriers for conduction [@Avouris2007; @Tran2016; @Heller2009a]. The current-voltage plots for a given transistor are known as the 'characteristic curves' of the transistor. The plot of $I_d$ against $V_g$ at constant $V_{ds}$ is known as the 'transfer' characteristic curve at that source-drain voltage, while the I-V curve of $I_d$ against $V_{ds}$ at constant $V_g$ is known as the 'source-drain' or 'output' characteristic curve at that gate voltage [@Petti2016; @Shkodra2021]. The transfer characteristics are governed by the gate capacitance, as discussed in @sec-gating. Both back-gated and liquid-gated transfer characteristics from ambipolar thin-film transistors are shown in @fig-gating-transfer. Taking regular transfer measurements of a graphene or carbon nanotube device is not only useful in building a complete picture of device behaviour, but also may help to ensure devices are kept highly sensitive to electrostatic gating effects through redistributing charge in the channel [@Noyce2019].

A variety of quantitative parameters can be extracted from the transfer characteristics of a thin-film transistor. A quantitative summary of a range of TFT parameters can be found in the thin-film transistor study by Petti *et al.* [@Petti2016]. The parameters of particular interest here are transconductance, on-off ratio, threshold voltage and subthreshold swing. Transconductance and on-off ratio are discussed below, while threshold voltage and subthreshold swing are discussed for the carbon nanotube network case specifically in @sec-electrical-characterisation-CNT. Other behaviours observed when measuring currents present in a thin-film device are also discussed below, including source-gate leakage current and the hysteresis and real-time signal drift of source-drain current.

Examples of field-effect transistor transfer characteristics taken at $V_{ds}$ = 100 mV from two different device channels. A linear scale is used in (a) and (b), while a logarithmic scale is used in (c) and (d). The curves in (a) and (c) are from backgated channels, while the curves in (b) and (d) are from liquid-gated channels. The linear fit with gradient corresponding to transconductance at $V_g$ = 0 V is shown in (a) and (b) with a dotted red line. The "on" current in (c) and (d) is shown with a red horizontal line, while the "off" current in (d) is shown with a blue horizontal line. 
:::

#### Transconductance {.unnumbered}

In the linear regime, transconductance at a specific gate voltage is given by $g_m = |dI_{d}/dV_g|$. Transconductance indicates how responsive the device is to electrostatic gating at a given gate voltage. In other words, when $g_m$ is large, small changes in $V_g$ can significantly modulate channel current $I_d$, which is useful for sensing [@Heller2009a; @Ohno2015]. Transconductance at a given gate voltage is also proportional to the mobility (movement) of charge carriers in the device channel, and therefore depends on the scattering properties of the material [@Rouhi2010; @Petti2016; @Li2023]. The transconductance at a specific gate voltage can be found from performing a linear fit in a small region around that voltage on the transfer curve. Linear fits for transconductance at $V_g = 0$ V are shown for a back-gated device in @fig-gating-transfer (a), and a liquid-gated device in @fig-gating-transfer (b), which give values of $g_m$ = 0.05 µS and $g_m$ = 1 µS respectively. The difference of several orders of magnitude between back-gated and liquid-gated transconductance corresponds to the difference of several orders of magnitude between back and liquid-gated gate capacitance [@Tran2016; @Shkodra2021]. Improved transconductance is therefore a significant advantage of the use of the liquid-gate.

#### On-off Ratio {.unnumbered}

Another important attribute of the transfer characteristic curve for all thin-film FETs is the on-off current ratio. On-off current ratio is the ratio of the current through a device when gated fully 'off' with a positive voltage, $I_{off}$, to the current through the device when gated fully 'on' with a negative voltage, $I_{on}$. The off current in an ambipolar FET can be defined as the minimum current during the transfer sweep, where the majority carrier transitions from being holes to electrons or *vice versa* [@Petti2016; @Zheng2017]. For example, for the channel shown in @fig-gating-transfer (b), $I_{on} = 741.5$ nA and $I_{off} = 0.2$ nA. Therefore, the on-off ratio $I_{on}/I_{off}$ is $\sim$ 3000. In contrast, even when 10 V is applied, the backgated device shown in @fig-gating-transfer (a) is never gated fully off. Being able to traverse both on and off regimes over a limited voltage interval is another advantage of the liquid-gated configuration. Having a low off current is desirable as it corresponds to low power consumption by the transistor [@Rouhi2010]. Overall, on-off ratio of a device is a useful figure of merit for switching which is relatively simple to both find and present.

#### Gate Leakage {.unnumbered}

Forward and reverse sweeps are shown for the back-gated case (a) and the liquid-gated case (b), with the direction of each sweep indicated by an arrow. A sweep rate of $V_{ds}$ = 100 mV/sample was used for the back-gated device and a sweep rate of $V_{ds}$ = 10 mV/sample was used for the liquid-gate device. The gate current measured during each sweep is also shown with a dotted line.
:::

Application of higher voltages to the gate in both the liquid-gate and back-gate cases can result in significant leakage currents through the gate. These currents mean that the insulating layer at the gate producing the capacitive effect no longer acts as an insulator, adversely affecting transistor quality [@Noyce2019; @Shkodra2021]. In the case of back-gated devices, gate leakage occurs due to conduction through the oxide dielectric. If the gate voltage produces an electric field exceeding the dielectric strength of the oxide, dielectric breakdown can occur, where the oxide layer no longer acts as an insulator. Breakdown results from voltage-induced oxygen vacancies in the SiO$_2$ lattice forming a conductive path through the insulator [@Padovani2017]. In the liquid-gated case, the choice of electrolyte determines the appropriate voltage range for electrical characterisation, since excessive voltages will drive electrolysis and induce redox reactions. For water-based electrolytes, gate voltages must be kept within the $\pm$ 1 V range [@Wang2010; @Ohno2015; @Shkodra2021]. In normal operation, gate current should appear negligible on a linear scale for both the back-gated and liquid-gated cases, as shown in @fig-gating-hysteresis.

#### Hysteresis and Baseline Drift {.unnumbered}

Thin-film transistor devices typically exhibit some degree of hysteresis, where the history of channel current affects future current behaviour. Hysteresis in carbon nanotube and graphene field-effect transistors is a result of filling or emptying of slow-discharge charge traps in the local environment of the channel. These charge traps exist either within the silicon dioxide insulator or at its interface with the channel, which can result from adsorption of water or other dopants [@McEuen2002; @Kim2003; @Wang2010]. A capacitive gating effect from charged ions also contributes to hysteresis, either due to the use of a electrolyte-gated environment or from charged surface contamination [@Wang2010]. Due to hysteresis, sweeping $V_g$ forwards across a set voltage range will result in a different $I_d - V_g$ characteristic curve than if $V_g$ is subsequently swept in the reverse direction over that same range. Hysteresis depends on the voltage range used for characterisation, the sweep rate and the environment of the transistor channel [@Kim2003; @Wang2010]. The difference between the forward and reverse sweep for both the back-gated and liquid-gated case is illustrated in @fig-gating-hysteresis. The hysteresis is significantly lower for the liquid-gated case, which may be explained by the reduced voltage range and sweep rate. However, the electrolyte layer may also prevent atmospheric adsorbents reaching the channel, further reducing hysteresis.

Memory effects are also present during current measurement when both source-drain and source-gate voltages are kept constant. These changes appear as a slow change in current, referred to here as either signal drift or baseline drift. In more extreme cases, baseline drift can obscure or even be confused with current changes attributable to analyte interaction during real-time sensing. Noyce *et al.* found that for carbon nanotube devices biased with $V_g = -15$ V, a period of steep signal drift was observed, which settled into a stable steady-state after $\sim$ 3 hours. It appears the signal drift, which occurred both in air and under vacuum conditions, was a result of trap states being filled in a manner that could be modelled using a sum of three exponentials. Changes in room temperature and ambient lighting were also found to contribute to signal noise and drift behaviours via separate mechanisms, but these contributions are relatively small. When numerous drift measurements were taken of the same device, even though the initial and final current values differed significantly between measurements, very similar settling behaviour was observed, indicating signal drift behaviour is reversible and characteristic of a particular channel [@Noyce2019]. 

As noted by Noyce *et al.*, the high demand for characterisation equipment in a standard device laboratory means that waiting over three hours for baseline drift to settle is impractical, and furthermore, extended periods of voltage application may degrade bio-functionalised devices. Since trap states are unavoidable to a degree [@DiMaria1993; @Collins2000], data analysis that accounts for baseline drift was therefore explored in some detail in this thesis.

## Graphene Field-Effect Transistors

### Graphene Properties

Graphene is a 2-dimensional material which consists of covalently bonded carbon atoms in a dense lattice of hexagonal cells [@McEuen2002; @Novoselov2004; @Geim2007; @Tran2016]. Graphene can be used to create a variety of low-dimensional graphitic nanomaterials, including carbon nanotubes [@McEuen2002] (see @sec-carbon-nanotubes). Monolayer and bilayer graphene are zero band-gap semiconductors, where traversing the electronic bandstructure in different directions gives rise to either metallic or semiconducting behaviour [@McEuen2002]. Adding more graphene layers adds more complexity to the bandstructure, with significant overlap between bands and reduced carrier mobility. When 10 or more layers are present, the structure behaves as 3D graphite [@Geim2007; @Ohno2015]. First isolated in 2004 [@Novoselov2004], monolayer graphene has many desirable electronic properties. Charge carrier transport is ballistic over submicrometer distances at room temperature, and as graphene is metallic even at the Dirac point, this transport is not inhibited by a Schottky barrier at the metal contacts of a device [@Novoselov2004; @Geim2007]. Graphene is also a highly chemically stable material. In particular, it will not readily oxidise in an electrolyte solution due to having a large 'electrochemical window'; in other words, it is too chemically stable to take part in electrochemical reactions within a large range of applied voltages [@Ohno2015; @Tran2016].

#### Graphene Folds {.unnumbered}

Vertical warping on the scale of tens of nanometers helps to stablise the graphene layer, increasing elastic energy but reducing the thermal vibrations which are large in a 2D material [@Geim2007].

Liquid-gated transfer characteristics of two graphene field-effect transistor channels. In (a), the Dirac point voltage is indicated by a red dotted line, and regions of hole conduction and electron conduction are also shown. The relative Fermi energy in each region is shown on graphene bandstructure insets (adapted from [@Geim2007; @Ohno2015]). The graphene channel in (b) has double conduction minima, which are highlighted with red arrows.
:::

When a gate voltage $V_g$ is applied to the channel of a graphene device, the Fermi energy is shifted and surface charge density is altered [@Novoselov2004; @Heller2010; @Ohno2015]. An increase in available charge means an increase in carriers available for conduction and increased $I_d$ [@Geim2007]. 




The transfer sweep behaviour is that of an ambipolar semiconductor, except there is no characteristic 'off' regime. The minimum conductance obtainable by gating occurs at what is known as the neutrality or Dirac point, where the population of charge carriers is at a minimum [@Novoselov2004; @Ohno2015]. At voltages close to the Dirac voltage, a mixed state exists where both electrons and holes are present. As gate voltage moves left away from the Dirac voltage, holes begin to dominate conduction, while when gate voltage is moved to the right of the Dirac voltage, electrons dominate [@Novoselov2004].

As gate voltage is increased or decreased away from the Dirac voltage, conductivity increases linearly [@Novoselov2004]. Typically, a monolayer graphene channel will conduct holes at zero gate voltage, which is due to the presence of atmospheric dopants such as water. By removing these dopants, the Dirac point feature can be brought closer to the zero gate voltage position on the transfer curve, indicating graphene is naturally a mixed-carrier conductor [@Novoselov2004]. 

The on-off ratio of the graphene transfer curve shown is 5. As graphene lacks a bandgap, there is a minimum possible conductance for graphene devices, which leads to a relatively small on-off ratio [@Novoselov2004; @Geim2007]. This attribute is a drawback of the graphene FET in sensing applications when compared with carbon nanotube transistors [@Novoselov2004]. However, the transconductance of the curve at $V_g$ = 0 V, $g_m$ = 1 µS, is similar to the liquid-gated transconductance of a carbon nanotube device shown earlier.

while the Dirac voltage is 0.29 V.

### Sensing Mechanisms

The large surface-to-volume ratio of graphene makes it highly sensitive to intermolecular interactions and therefore appropriate for use in sensing applications [@Ohno2015; @Tran2016]. An analyte molecule can be detected using a graphene channel by observing the change in current that occurs when a charged analyte alters the channel Fermi level [@Heller2010; @Ohno2015]. 


## Random-Network Carbon Nanotube Field-Effect Transistors

### Carbon Nanotube Properties {#sec-carbon-nanotubes}

Since their initial identification in 1991 [@Iijima1991], a wide range of applications for carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been proposed, due to their small mass, elasticity, strength, and unique electronic properties. A single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) consists of a monolayer graphene sheet rolled up into a cylinder, while a multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) consists of several monolayer graphene cylinders where smaller cylinders are coaxially contained by larger cylinders [@Dekker1999; @Avouris2007; @Cao2009; @Rouhi2010]. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes may suffer from significant scattering at defects and diffusive electron motion [@Dekker1999]. However, single-walled carbon nanotubes are relatively defect-free, and carrier transport within nanotubes is near-ballistic at room temperature, resulting in high carrier mobility [@Avouris2007; @Rouhi2010; @Dekker1999; @Cao2009; @Shkodra2021]. The momentum of charge carriers in a single-walled carbon nanotube is quantised, confining carriers to 2-dimensional slices across the 3-dimensional graphene bandstructure. If a slice contains a bandgap, the carbon nanotube behaves as a semiconductor (s-CNT); if not, the nanotube behaves as a metal (m-CNT) [@McEuen2002]. The high surface-to-volume ratio of small-diameter single-walled carbon nanotubes makes them extremely sensitive and therefore particularly suitable for sensing applications [@Cao2009; @Shkodra2021]. Like graphene, carbon nanotubes have a large potential window, and are therefore not readily oxidised in a liquid-gate environment [@Ohno2015].

![Diagram illustrating how a graphene sheet can be rolled up at various angles to form carbon nanotubes. The two black dotted lines represent boundaries which can be cut across and then brought into contact to form a cylinder. The cylinder here is referred to by the integer pair (6,4), as the chiral vector $C_h$, the vector perpendicular to the cut through the sheet, is given by $C_h = 6a_1+4a_2$. The chiral vector forms the circumference of the rolled carbon nanotube. The left edge in the zigzag ($n$,0) and armchair ($n$,$n$) cases are shown with a blue and purple dotted line respectively. The location of the right edge (diameter of the nanotube) is determined by the value chosen for $n$. Adapted from [@Dekker1999; @Lu2012].](figures/ch2/carbon_nanotube_wrapping.png){#carbon-nanotube-wrapping width="75%"}


The chirality and diameter of a carbon nanotube determines its electronic bandstructure and whether it has semiconducting or metallic characteristics [@Martel1998; @Dekker1999; @McEuen2002; @Avouris2007]. The nanotube chirality indices ($n$,$m$) determine the chiral angle at which hexagons wind around the nanotube relative to the longitudinal axis of the nanotube. This chiral angle is the angle between the chiral vector $\textbf{C}_h = n\textbf{a}_1+m\textbf{a}_2$, which maps to the circumference of the nanotube, and the basis vector $\textbf{a}_1$, which is parallel to a row of hexagons. The size of the chiral angle $\theta$ is given by @eq-chiral-angle, the diameter of the resulting carbon nanotube is given by $d=|C_h|/\pi$ [@Lu2012]. 

$$
\theta = \arcsin\frac{\sqrt{3}m}{2\sqrt{n^2+nm+m^2}}, \space n > m
$$ {#eq-chiral-angle}

When $m=0$, $\theta = 0°$, and the resulting carbon nanotube has a 'zigzag' structure; when $m=n$, $\theta = 30°$, and the carbon nanotube has an 'armchair' structure. When $\theta$ is between $0°-30°$, the structure is referred to as 'chiral' [@Dekker1999; @Lu2012]. When $n-m=3z$, where $z$ is an integer, the resulting carbon nanotube is metallic $-$ for example, if $n=5$ and $m=5$, $z=0$ and the tube is metallic with an armchair structure. All other nanotubes are semiconducting, including the (6,4) chiral nanotube described in @carbon-nanotube-wrapping. Out of the chiral arrangements available, two-thirds of the possible structures are semiconducting while one-third is metallic [@Dekker1999]. 

### Carbon Nanotube Networks 

Although a single carbon nanotube can be used as the channel of a thin-film transistor, this approach has significant drawbacks. It is difficult to ensure good device-to-device reproducibility with a single nanotube present, and the amount of current which can be placed through a single nanotube is relatively low. An alternative approach is to use a large-scale network of carbon nanotubes as the transistor channel. In a network of carbon nanotubes, the individual electrical properties of the CNTs are averaged out across the network, minimising device-to-device variation. Furthermore, the large area of coverage both ensures high currents and increases the likelihood of interactions with the local environment in sensing applications [@Hu2004; @Cao2009; @Murugathas2019a]. Carbon nanotube networks can either be aligned or randomly deposited [@Cao2009]; in this thesis, randomly deposited networks were fabricated using facile solution-deposition methods. Important attributes of a carbon nanotube film include the density of the network (number of nanotubes per unit area), the ratio of metallic to semiconducting nanotubes present, and the distribution of nanotube diameters present [@Cao2009]. The strong van der Waals forces between carbon nanotubes leads to bundles of carbon nanotubes being present in a network, which may contain many nanotubes of different size and chirality [@Fuhrer2000; @Hu2004; @Cao2009; @Murugathas2019a].

In a network carbon nanotube device with metal electrodes, transistor switching is affected by changes occurring at the interface between the electrodes and the semiconducting carbon nanotubes. A Schottky barrier forms at this interface due to a difference in work function between the metal and semiconducting CNTs. This difference leads to a bending of the conduction and valence bands and the formation of an electric dipole layer at the junction. The metal used has a direct impact on barrier height $\phi_B$, which results from the absence of metal-semiconductor bonding [@Avouris2007; @Cao2009; @Topinka2009; @Li2023]. The spatial extent of the dipole layer is called the barrier thickness. For unipolar transistors, where the Schottky barrier is thick, the channel-electrode contact determines the type of charge carrier passing between source and drain. A contact which forms a low Schottky barrier for holes will form a high Schottky barrier for electrons, and holes dominate conduction. The reverse applies for a contact with a high Schottky barrier for holes, where electrons dominate conduction [@Avouris2007; @Heller2008; @Shkodra2021]. Semiconducting thin-film devices can be ambipolar, where charge carriers quantum-mechanically tunnel through thin Schottky barriers, and electrons and holes can both flow through the channel [@Avouris2007; @Heller2008].

The behaviour of carbon nanotube network transistors is also influenced by potential barriers existing at junctions between carbon nanotubes within the network. Schottky barriers exist at metallic-semiconducting junctions (m-s junctions), while a heterojunction barrier exists between semiconducting nanotubes of different bandgap (s-s' junctions) [@Fuhrer2000; @Murugathas2019a]. These potential barriers mean resistance across these junctions is significantly higher than across a junction between metallic nanotubes (m-m junction) or semiconducting nanotubes of the same bandgap (s-s junction) [@Fuhrer2000].  The density of the nanotube network determines the relative contribution of Schottky barriers to device behaviour. In a sparse network with a high proportion of semiconducting tubes, there may be many junctions but no percolating pathways that entirely consist of  nanotubes of one type, meaning Schottky barriers will severely limit conductance. In a dense network, percolating paths composed entirely of one type of nanotube may be present which can bypass the Schottky barriers [@Hu2004]. 


When the channel length is much larger than that of individual nanotubes, these junctions form percolation pathways which channel current must pass through. If only one percolation pathway exists across a sparse network, the network density is at the 'percolation threshold'. If a network is below the percolation threshold, the channel will not conduct [@Hu2004]. The chiral composition of percolating pathways has important consequences for channel resistance. Each junction across a percolating pathway is an interface with an associated resistance.

Like graphene transistors, carbon nanotube transistors are naturally ambipolar: they can conduct both electrons and holes. Holes travel at highly negative voltages, while electrons travel at highly positive voltages. At intermediary voltages, both electrons and holes flow. Transistor behaviour can be made unipolar through doping the semiconducting carbon nanotubes or by choosing an electrode metal with a particularly high work function, increasing the Schottky barrier for one type of charge [@Avouris2007; @Cao2009]. For example, the use of gold electrodes promotes $p$-type behaviour over $n$-type behaviour due to the work function of the metal; adsorption of oxygen from the air will weakly dope the semiconducting carbon nanotubes and likewise promote $p$-type behaviour [@McEuen2002; @Cao2009; @Shkodra2021]. Partial alignment of a random-network carbon nanotube network maximises the transconductance of a device, as this creates more semiconducting pathways while maintaining the presence of junctions within the network [@Cao2009; @Rouhi2010].

The threshold voltage $V_t$ is the gate voltage required to increase the height of the Schottky barriers at the contacts or within the network until semiconducting nanotube charge carriers can no longer pass over the barrier [@Avouris2007; @Topinka2009]. For a $p$-type semiconductor channel, increasing $V_g$ towards positive gate voltages will raise the Schottky barrier and turn current off, with the opposite being true for an $n$-type channel. There are therefore two threshold voltages for these devices, $V_{t,h}$ and $V_{t,e}$. Within the range between these gate voltages, both holes and electrons flow through the channel [@Avouris2007; @Reiner-Rozman2015]. Conduction across metallic nanotubes is largely unaffected by changes in $V_g$ [@Fuhrer2000; @Topinka2009]. The on-off ratio of a carbon nanotube device is largely decided by the ratio of s-CNTs to m-CNTs. If the current from quantum tunnelling of charge carriers between the electrodes and semiconducting CNTs is negligible, the pathways containing only metallic carbon nanotubes in the network determines the size of $I_{off}$. Therefore, unlike a graphene device, the off current can be readily modified by changing the proportion of metallic carbon nanotubes present in the network [@Hu2004; @Cao2009; @Rouhi2010]. 

In a liquid-gated environment, gate leakage currents may approach that of the carbon nanotube channel drain current, especially if the network used is sparse. This can lead to significant device noise. The relative prominence of liquid-gate leakage current when using sparse carbon nanotube FETs therefore means using a dense network or a graphene device can give enhanced signal-to-noise ratio during sensing [@Ohno2015].





The threshold voltage is the voltage required to fully deplete the device channel of charge carriers [@Martel1998]. It can be estimated by extrapolating the linear part of the transfer characteristics of a device to the $V_g$ axis.

The FET turns on at the ‘threshold voltage’, $V_g$ = $V_t$. For the $p$-type FET, when $V_g$ > $V_t$, $I_d$ increases linearly.

From extrapolating
the trendline of the linear region to the $V_g$ axis, the intercept $V_{gInt}$ is approximately equivalent to $V_t$ [@Sze2006].

$V_t$ can be estimated by extrapolating the linear region of the transfer characteristics of a device to the $V_g$ axis. The value for $V_g$ at this intercept is approximately equal to $V_t$ when $V_{ds}$ is close to zero [@Sze2006]. It should be noted that it is difficult to relate this estimate for $V_t$ for thin-film field-effect transistors to carrier density directly. Instead, the value found for $V_t$ should be considered as a useful parameter for comparing the gating behaviour of different devices [@Schoonveld2001].

Threshold Voltage: minimum gate-to-source voltage that is needed to create a conducting path between the electrodes

Quantative measurement of leftward shift in transfer curve
Use minima of curve in reverse sweep direction (more consistent than reading in forward sweep direction)
I compared the transfer characteristics after then rinse steps to the pristine characteristics
Transfer shifts where current drops to zero are excluded (indicates delamination/damage to channel)

Second quantative measurement of leftward shift in transfer curve
Use curve in reverse sweep direction (more consistent than reading in forward sweep direction)
Separate readings for left and right hand sides of transfer curve (left side = electrons dominant carrier, right side = holes dominant carrier)
Transfer shifts where current drops to zero are excluded (indicates delamination/damage to channel)
This gives us a quantitative idea of whether the transfer shifts in slides 5/6 are stable (remain the same/similar after rinse steps)

### Sensing Mechanisms

Like graphene, as carbon nanotubes have a high proportion of exposed surface atoms they are very sensitive to their surroundings, making them suitable for sensing purposes [@Cao2009; @Yao2021; @Shkodra2021]. The chirality and diameter of a carbon nanotube affects both its coupling with the gate and its surface chemistry, impacting the type of sensing mechanisms which can take place when a single CNT is present. The switching behaviour due to electrostatic gating only applies to semiconducting, and not metallic, carbon nanotubes. Metallic carbon nanotubes have been found to be more chemically reactive than semiconducting carbon nanotubes, which may result from their finite density of states near the Fermi level. Larger diameter carbon nanotubes are also more reactive due to more carbon bonding hybridisation configurations being available [@Cao2009]. Carbon nanotubes have been used for vapour-phase sensing since 2000, when Kong *et al.* found that the resistance over a single CNT channel was modified when exposed to gas molecules like NO$_2$ and NH$_3$ [@Kong2000]. In a range of gas sensor applications, carbon nanotubes can detect the presence of analyte at the parts per billion level [@Cao2009; @Battie2011; @Boyd2014; @Chen2019]. However, their high sensitivity comes with the disadvantage of low specificity or selectivity $-$ nanotubes respond to many different analytes in a similar manner. To enhance specificity, surface functionalisation can be used, which may use either inorganic or biological materials, including DNA and proteins [@Cao2009].

For carbon nanotube network transistors, sensing mechanisms include electrostatic gating, charge transfer, Schottky barrier modulation, capacitance modulation and charge scattering. Response mechanisms may take place at the gate, the junctions between channel and contact, or at the semiconductor channel [@Heller2008; @Battie2011; @Boyd2014; @Tran2016; @Li2023]. Modification of the channel-metal Schottky barrier can dominate sensing activity, and this can complicate the identification of mechanisms underlying the sensing behaviour [@Cao2009; @Boyd2014; @Schroeder2019]. The encapsulation layer shown in @fig-gating-schematics is added to separate the electrodes from the channel-metal junction and prevent these responses [@Heller2008; @Shkodra2021]. If there are few m-s and s-s' present in an encapsulated device, the predominant sensing mechanism is either charge transfer from the analyte to channel [@Allen2007; @Battie2011] or electrostatic gating [@Heller2008]. The charge transfer mechanism involves direct addition of charge carriers to the channel, while the gating mechanism results from a nearby charge inducing an opposite polarity charge in the channel. Both changes alter the relationship between $V_g$ and $I_d$ and shift the carrier threshold voltages [@Tran2016; @Shkodra2021]. However, if many m-s or s-s' junctions are present, the modulation of Schottky barriers between metallic and semiconducting carbon nanotubes may make a significant contribution to sensing responses [@Boyd2014; @Murugathas2019a].
