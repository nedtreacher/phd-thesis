# Carbon Nanotube and Graphene Field-Effect Transistors

## Introduction

Out of a wide range of available transducer options available for the creation of compact, portable and highly-integrated biosensors, field-effect transistors are among the most promising. Field-effect transistors, initially proposed in the 1930s, consist of two conductive electrodes on either side of a semiconducting channel, the 'source' and 'drain' electrodes, alongside an isolated 'gate' electrode which is typically perpendicular to the channel. An applied electric field from the gate electrode capacitively controls channel resistance, giving rise to the label 'field-effect'. By adjusting gate voltage, the flow of charge carriers between source and drain can be varied over several orders of magnitude. The ability of this simple structure to obtain a large signal response from small changes in channel behaviour means field-effect transistors can be used as high-quality amplifiers for sensor applications [@Petti2016; @Shkodra2021; @Yao2021]. Field-effect transistors are typically unipolar transistors; channel conduction either mainly consists of electron carriers, or hole carriers, depending on the electrode and channel materials used [@Yao2021].

Carbon nanotube network and graphene field-effect transistors (CNTFETs and GFETs) are both examples of a class of field-effect transistors called thin-film transistors (TFTs). These transistors, first developed in 1962 [@Weimer1962], are closely related to the commonly-used metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET). Unlike MOSFETs, thin-film transistors do not use the substrate as the device channel. Instead, current passes through a semiconducting film on the surface of the device;the films discussed here are graphene and carbon nanotubes, two carbon-based 2D nanomaterials. Since thin-film transistors do not require a conductive substrate, they can be fabricated using light, flexible and stretchable substrates, making them significantly more versatile than MOSFETs [@Sun2013; @Petti2016; @Shkodra2021]. While the principle of modulating current with a gate electrode is shared by the MOSFET and TFT, the underlying physics behind the transistor behaviour differs between the two. While the MOSFET is turned on by the change in carrier behaviour when switching from an depletion to an inversion mode, switching in a TFT looks significantly different [@Petti2016]. This behaviour is detailed in the subsequent section.

## Thin-Film Field-Effect Transistors {#sec-general-FETs}

### Structure and Gating {#sec-gating}

The basic components of the thin-film transistor can be configured in a variety of different ways. These configurations include the back-gated field-effect transistor and the liquid-gated transistor, also known as the electrolyte-gated transistor. The relatively simple back-gated configuration, shown in @fig-gating-schematics (a), uses the silicon substrate as the gate. The channel is isolated from the gate with a thin silicon dioxide layer. A liquid-gated device, shown in @fig-gating-schematics (b), is used for sensitive liquid analyte detection. In the most common form of this configuration, a Ag/AgCl reference electrode is used as the gate. The channel is isolated from the gate by the bulk of an electrolyte solution, typically the biofriendly phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Other aqueous salt solutions, polymers and ion-gels are also sometimes used as the electrolyte gate. The electrolyte is restricted to the channel area using a hydrophobic PDMS microchamber, referred to here as a 'PDMS well' [@Avouris2007; @Shkodra2021; @Li2023].

A graphene monolayer or a carbon nanotube network is used as the transistor thin-film. The drain electrode is the gold contact on the left side of each figure, while the source electrode is the gold contact on the right.

When the source and drain electrodes of a thin-film field-effect transistor are made of metal, a Schottky barrier forms between the channel and the electrodes. The Schottky barrier results from a difference in the work function between the metal and semiconducting channel, leading to bending of the conduction and valence bands and the formation of an electric dipole layer at the junction. Due to the absence of metal-channel bonding, the metal used has a direct impact on barrier height $\phi_B$ [@Avouris2007; @Li2023]. The spatial extent of the dipole layer is called the barrier thickness. For unipolar transistors, where the Schottky barrier is thick, the channel-electrode contact determines the type of charge carrier passing between source and drain. A contact which forms a low Schottky barrier for holes will form a high Schottky barrier for electrons. In this case, holes flow and the device is $p$-type. The reverse applies for a contact with a high Schottky barrier for holes, where electrons flow and the device is $n$-type. Thin-film devices can also be ambipolar, where charge carriers can quantum-mechanically tunnel through thin Schottky barriers and electrons and holes can both flow through the channel [@Avouris2007; @Heller2008; @Shkodra2021; @Yao2021].

Two different voltages are used to adjust transistor operation. The first is the 'drain bias', $V_{ds}$, between the drain and source electrodes, and the second is the 'gate bias', $V_g$, applied between the gate and source electrode. Changing $V_g$ alters the energy band bending at the channel-electrode junctions, and therefore also alters the energy barriers at these junctions. The value of $V_g$ determines whether charge carriers may flow under the influence of $V_{ds}$ and produce a drain-source current $I_d$; in other words, $V_g$ determines whether the transistor is 'on' or 'off'. The relative effect of changes in $V_g$ on source-drain current $I_d$ is determined by gate capacitance, which is a series combination of the geometric capacitance, $C_{G}$, and the quantum capacitance of the 2D nanomaterial, $C_{Q}$. For a back-gated device, geometric capacitance is predominantly due to the oxide layer capacitance $C_{ox}$ [@Avouris2007;@Heller2009a; @Li2023]. 

The threshold voltage $V_t$ is the gate voltage required to increase the Schottky barrier height to a point where charge carriers no longer flow. For a $p$-type semiconductor channel, increasing $V_g$ towards positive gate voltages will raise the Schottky barrier and turn current off, with the opposite being true for an $n$-type channel. In an ambipolar transistor, a highly negative $V_g$ will give rise to hole conduction, and a highly positive $V_g$ will give rise to electron conduction. There are therefore two threshold voltages for these devices, $V_{t,h}$ and $V_{t,e}$. Within the range between these gate voltages, both holes and electrons flow through the channel [@Avouris2007; @Reiner-Rozman2015; @Yao2021; @Li2023]. When $|V_{ds}| < |V_g| - |V_t|$ and the device is gated on, the device is in the linear regime. In this regime, $V_{ds}$ is directly proportional to $I_{d}$, similar to an Ohmic resistor. When $|V_{ds}| > |V_g| - |V_t|$ and the device is on, the device is in the saturation regime, where the relationship between $V_{ds}$ and $I_{d}$ becomes non-linear [@Petti2016; @Shkodra2021].

The gating configuration used influences the type of biological sensing mechanisms available, which include electrostatic gating, Schottky barrier modulation, capacitance modulation and charge scattering. Response mechanisms may take place at the gate, the junctions between channel and contact, or at the semiconductor channel [@Heller2008; @Li2023]. Any modification of the channel-metal Schottky barrier dominates sensing, and these responses are considered to be unreliable. The encapsulation layer shown in @fig-gating-schematics is added to separate the electrodes from the channel-metal junction and prevent these responses [@Heller2008]. The predominant sensing mechanism is then either charge transfer from the analyte to channel [@Allen2007] or electrostatic gating [@Heller2008]. The charge transfer mechanism involves direct addition of charge carriers to the channel, while the gating mechanism results from the presence of a charge near the channel inducing an opposite polarity charge in the channel. Both changes alter the relationship between $V_g$ and $I_d$ and shift the threshold voltage(s) [@Shkodra2021]. 

#### Liquid-Gating and Debye Length {.unnumbered}

![A diagram of the formation of an electric double layer (EDL) under an applied voltage between source and liquid-gate electrodes, with a $p$-type semiconductor used for the channel thin-film. Electric double layers are present at both the gate-electrolyte interface and semiconductor-electrolyte interface. Adapted from [@Shkodra2021; @Tiwari2022].](figures/ch2/Debye-length-schematic.png){#fig-Debye-length width="60%"}

Understanding the ionic behaviour of the gate electrolyte used in a liquid-gated device setup gives insight into the gating and sensing behaviour of the setup. When a voltage is applied at the liquid-gate, the charged ions in solution move to form two electric double layers, one at the interface between the electrolyte and gate electrode, and one at the interface between electrolyte and semiconducting channel, as shown in @fig-Debye-length. The gate capacitance is a series combination of the capacitance of each EDL in series with quantum capacitance $C_{Q}$. The Gouy-Chapman-Stern model splits the EDL into two distinct regions, the first being a compact layer of ions, the Stern layer, and the second being a more diffuse layer, the Gouy-Chapman layer. The surface potential of the solid-electrolyte interface exponentially decreases across the diffuse region of the double-layer; the characteristic length of this potential screening is known as Debye length, $\lambda_D$. The typical electrolyte Debye length is on a nanometer scale, therefore the bulk electrolyte acts as an insulator, similar to the silicon dioxide dielectric in the back-gated configuration. The Stern layer capacitance is inversely proportional to the Debye length, and therefore decreased $\lambda_D$ corresponds to increased gate capacitance [@Israelachvili2011; @Shkodra2021; @Yao2021; @Tiwari2022].

$$
\lambda_D = \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_0\epsilon_rk_bT}{2N_Aq^2I}}
$$ {#eq-debye-length}

The equation for Debye length $\lambda_D$ in an electrolyte solution is given by @eq-debye-length, where $\epsilon_0$ is vacuum permittivity, $\epsilon_r$ is the relative permittivity of the electrolyte, $\k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is absolute temperature in K, $N_A$ is the Avogadro number, $q$ is the elementary charge and $I$ is ionic strength in mmol L$^{-1}$. When temperature is kept constant, $\lambda_D$ only depends on the ionic strength of the electrolyte and not on any attributes of the gate electrode or channel. Successive dilutions of a particular electrolyte will increase the Debye length: for $1 \times$ PBS, $\lambda_D$ is 0.7 nm, for $0.1 \times$ PBS, $\lambda_D$ is 2.3 nm, for $0.01 \times$ PBS $\lambda_D$ is 7.3 nm and so on. This means gate capacitance is directly dependent on the electrolyte used and its concentration. A $1 \times$ PBS electrolyte gives a gate capacitance several orders of magnitude larger than that of a silicon oxide back-gate. A larger capacitance significantly increases the effect of electrostatic gating on the channel current, often described as increased electrostatic coupling between gate and channel. A liquid-gated device with low Debye length will therefore be highly sensitive to electrostatic changes across a small voltage range [@Israelachvili2011; @Shkodra2021; @Yao2021]. 

However, a decreased Debye length also has disadvantages for sensing. Electrostatic potentials outside of the electrolyte-channel electrical double layer are effectively screened from the channel. Electrical double layers will also form around biomolecules such as DNA present within the solution. The combined screening effect means signals due to potential changes in charged biomolecules within the bulk electrolyte will have no effect on gating of the channel, and therefore no effect on $I_d$. Interactions between the analyte and any biorecognition element must therefore occur within the Debye length, and so a tradeoff exists between channel sensitivity and the size of the sensitive region above the channel. Many medium or large proteins will require a relatively dilute electrolyte for analyte capture to be detected by the channel, which may not reflect the intended environment for biosensor application [@Stern2007; @Piccinini2018; @Shkodra2021]. Other approaches to increasing Debye length without reducing device sensitivity have therefore also been trialled. One approach involves attaching a layer of polyethylene glycol polymer (PEG) to the channel, limiting the approach of counterions. This increases Debye length at the electrolyte-channel interface while preserving the capacitance of the electrolyte-gate interface, keeping device sensitivity relatively high [@Gao2016; @Kesler2020].

### Electrical Characterisation

Both carbon nanotube field effect transistors and graphene field-effect transistors are naturally ambipolar [@Avouris2007; @Heller2009a]. Applying a gate voltage $V_g$ to the gate of an ambipolar thin-film transistor influences the amount and type of available charge carriers through altering the energy bands of the channel and therefore the electrode-channel Schottky barriers. The current-voltage plots for a given transistor are known as the 'characteristic curves' of the transistor. The plot of $I_d$ against $V_g$ at constant $V_{ds}$ is known as the 'transfer' characteristic curve at that source-drain voltage, while the I-V curve of $I_d$ against $V_{ds}$ at constant $V_g$ is known as the 'source-drain' or 'output' characteristic curve at that gate voltage [@Petti2016; @Shkodra2021]. The transfer characteristics are governed by the gate capacitance, as discussed in @sec-gating. Both back-gated and liquid-gated transfer characteristics from ambipolar thin-film transistors are shown in @fig-gating-transfer. 

A variety of quantitative parameters can be extracted from the transfer characteristics of a thin-film transistor. A more comprehensive list and derivation of these characteristics can be found in the thin-film transistor study by Petti *et al.* [@Petti2016]. The parameters of particular interest here are transconductance, on-off ratio, threshold voltage and subthreshold swing. Transconductance and on-off ratio are discussed below, while threshold voltage and subthreshold swing are discussed for the carbon nanotube network case specifically in @sec-electrical-characterisation-CNT (for threshold voltage in the case of graphene devices, see Reiner-Rozman *et al.* [@Reiner-Rozman2015]). Also discussed below are some of the less-easily quantified behaviours observed when measuring currents present in a thin-film device, such as source-gate leakage current and the hysteresis and real-time baseline drift of source-drain current.

A linear scale is used in (a) and (b), while a logarithmic scale is used in (c) and (d). The curves in (a) and (c) are from backgated channels, while the curves in (b) and (d) are from liquid-gated channels. The linear fit with gradient corresponding to transconductance at $V_g$ = 0 V is shown in (a) and (b) with a dotted red line. The "on" current in (c) and (d) is shown with a red horizontal line, while the "off" current in (d) is shown with a blue horizontal line. 
:::

#### Transconductance {.unnumbered}

In the linear regime, transconductance at a specific gate voltage is given by $g_m = |dI_{d}/dV_g|$. Transconductance indicates how responsive the device is to electrostatic gating at a given gate voltage. In other words, when $g_m$ is large, small changes in $V_g$ can significantly modulate channel current $I_d$, which is useful for sensing [@Heller2009a]. Transconductance at a given gate voltage is also proportional to the mobility of charge carriers in the device channel [@Petti2016; @Zheng2017; @Li2023]. The transconductance at a specific gate voltage can be found from performing a linear fit in a small region around that voltage on the transfer curve. Linear fits for transconductance at $V_g = 0$ V are shown for a back-gated device in @fig-gating-transfer (a), and a liquid-gated device in @fig-gating-transfer (b), which give values of $g_m = 5 \times 10^{-8} S$ and $g_m = 100 \times 10^{-8} S$ respectively. The order of magnitude difference between back-gated and liquid-gated transconductance illustrates their order of magnitude difference in gate capacitance [@Tiwari2022]. However, applying the gate voltage that gives maximum transconductance may not always give the optimal sensing configuration. Heller *et al.* argued that gating carbon nanotube devices in the subthreshold regime led to sensing with superior signal-to-noise ratio [@Heller2009].

#### On-off Ratio {.unnumbered}

Another important attribute of the transfer characteristic curve for all thin-film FETs is the on-off current ratio. On-off current ratio is the ratio of the current through a device when gated fully 'off' with a positive voltage, to the current through the device when gated fully 'on' with a negative voltage [@Petti2016; @Zheng2017]. The off current in an ambipolar FET can be defined as the minimum current during the transfer sweep, where the majority carrier transitions from being holes to electrons or vice versa. For example, the on current of the channel shown in @fig-gating-transfer (b) is 741.5 nA, the off current is 0.2 nA, and therefore the on-off ratio is $\sim$ 3000. In contrast, even when 10 V is applied, the backgated device shown in @fig-gating-transfer (a) is never gated fully off. Being able to traverse both on and off regimes over a limited voltage interval is one of the many advantages of the liquid-gated configuration.

#### Gate Leakage {.unnumbered}

Application of higher voltages to the gate in both the liquid-gate and back-gate cases can result in significant leakage currents through the gate. These currents mean that the insulating layer at the gate producing the capacitive effect no longer acts as an insulator, undermining the transistor behaviour of the device.  , and can even result in irreversible breakdown of the oxide layer [@Petti2016].

In the liquid-gated case, the choice of electrolyte determines the appropriate voltage range for electrical characterisation, since excessive voltages will induce redox reactions. For water-based electrolytes, gate voltages must be kept within the $\pm$ 1 V range [@Shkodra2021]. 

Channel carriers in a FET can be accelerated by a sufficiently high gate-channel field into surmounting the insulating barrier between the gate and channel. This is known as 'breakdown'. The breakdown voltage $V_b$ gives an upper limit to the bias able to be applied across the device without the device being destroyed. Percolation theory can be used to explain breakdown. As energetic carriers pass through the oxide, defects are created randomly. When these random defects are dense enough to form a chain from the gate to the semiconductor, a short is created and breakdown occurs. With decreased oxide thickness the the required voltage for breakdown also decreases, due to increased carrier tunnelling.

Then leakage also occurs when electrolyte conducts

### Hysteresis and Baseline Drift {.unnumbered}

As $C_{qm} \gg C_{edl}$, hysteresis is significantly reduced for the liquid-gated configuration relative to the back-gated configuration. In this work, the liquid-gate is completely isolated from the channel, which ensures sensing is not due to modulation of the Schottky barrier between the channel and electrodes, but this is not always true for thin-film transistors in the literature [@Li2023].

It is important to account for the changes in current that occur during a sensing run that are unrelated to sensing, and try to minimise these changes as much as possible. These changes are due to a variety of causes and can be categorised as various types of noise and baseline drift. (1/f noise paper, heller paper)

As graphene field-effect transistors do not possess a characteristic 'off' regime. In normal operation of a GFET, the lowest voltage obtainable by gating is known as the
Dirac voltage [@Murugathas2020].

## Random-Network Carbon Nanotube Field-Effect Transistors

### Composition and Chirality

A single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) consists of a graphene sheet, a flat carbon lattice with hexagonal cells, rolled up into a cylinder. Since their discovery in 1991, a wide range of device applications for carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been proposed, based on CNTs being highly sensitive to their environment [@Iijima1991; @Dekker1999]. This high sensitivity is due to the high surface-to-volume ratio of the CNTs, which maximises the exposure of this electrically sensitive structure to its surroundings [@Yao2021; @Shkodra2021]. SWCNT-based devices consume little power, operate quickly and are highly flexible [@Shkodra2021]. Nanotubes in a network can have semiconducting characteristics (s-CNTs) or metallic characteristics (m-CNTs), depending on their chirality [@Martel1998; @Kong2000]. A single CNT will therefore have different properties than a network of CNTs, where the individual electrical properties of the CNT tubes are averaged out across the network [@Battie2010]. The contact between the electrodes and carbon nanotubes determines the behaviour of channel carriers. The properties of electrodes generally used in CNT FETs means they usually operate as $p$-type transistors [@Yao2021].

Able to conduct ballistically, good coupling between gate and channel electric fields with carbon nanotube devices which enables shorter channel sizes [@Avouris2007] carbon nanotube devices in the electrolyte-gated layout have stronger channel-gate coupling than the back-gated layout [@Heller2009a]

Semiconducting carbon nanotubes have particular advantages for use in sensor applications, including a high carrier mobility, compatibility with many biological targets, and ease of processing [@Shkodra2021].

The subthreshold slope is shown with a black dotted line, while the threshold voltages are shown with red dotted lines. The ON and OFF regimes are also indicated on both figures.
:::

Like graphene transistors, carbon nanotube transistors are naturally ambipolar: they can conduct both electrons and holes. Holes travel at highly negative voltages, while electrons travel at highly positive voltages. At intermediary voltages, both electrons and holes flow. Carbon nanotube transistors can also be doped into behaving as a unipolar transistor [@Avouris2007]. If heavily oxygen doped, the semiconducting carbon nanotubes will exhibit $p$-type behaviour, with current flow only occuring in a negative bias state [@Shkodra2021].

#### Threshold Voltage {.unnumbered}

The threshold voltage is the voltage required to fully deplete the device channel of charge carriers [@Martel1998]. It can be estimated by extrapolating the linear part of the transfer characteristics of a device to the $V_g$ axis.

The FET turns on at the ‘threshold voltage’, $V_g$ = $V_t$. For the $p$-type FET, when $V_g$ > $V_t$, $I_d$ increases linearly.

After decreasing past $V_t$, $I_d$ stays
constant at its ‘on’ value $I_{ON}$. The ratio of $I_{ON}$ to the $I_{OFF}$ current is known as the FET device’s ‘on-off ratio’, $I_{ON}/I_{OFF}$. The threshold voltage can be calculated by using an FET’s transfer characteristics. From extrapolating
the trendline of the linear region to the $V_g$ axis, the intercept $V_{gInt}$ is approximately equivalent to $V_t$ [@Sze2006].

$V_t$ can be estimated by extrapolating the linear region of the transfer characteristics of a device to the $V_g$ axis. The value for $V_g$ at this intercept is approximately equal to $V_t$ when $V_{ds}$ is close to zero [@Sze2006]. It should be noted that it is difficult to relate this estimate for $V_t$ for thin-film field-effect transistors to carrier density directly. Instead, the value found for $V_t$ should be considered as a useful parameter for comparing the gating behaviour of different devices [@Schoonveld2001].

Threshold Voltage: minimum gate-to-source voltage that is needed to create a conducting path between the electrodes

Quantative measurement of leftward shift in transfer curve

Transfer shifts where current drops to zero are excluded (indicates delamination/damage to channel)

Second quantative measurement of leftward shift in transfer curve
Use curve in reverse sweep direction (more consistent than reading in forward sweep direction)
Separate readings for left and right hand sides of transfer curve (left side = electrons dominant carrier, right side = holes dominant carrier)
Transfer shifts where current drops to zero are excluded (indicates delamination/damage to channel)
This gives us a quantitative idea of whether the transfer shifts in slides 5/6 are stable (remain the same/similar after rinse steps)
