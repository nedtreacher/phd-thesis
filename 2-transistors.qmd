# Carbon Nanotube and Graphene Field-Effect Transistors

## Ambipolar Field-Effect Transistors

### General Notes {#sec-general-FETs}

Carbon nanotube network and graphene field-effect transistors (CNTFETs and GFETs) are voltage-gated transistors that use a network of carbon nanotubes, or graphene, as a channel for current from the source to the drain electrode.

CNTFETs are mainly p-type transistors with positive charge carriers \cite{martel_single-_1998,kong_nanotube_2000}, while GFETs are ambipolar \cite{ohno_chemical_2010}. Applying an gate voltage $V_g$ to the gate of a CNTFET or GFET increases (or decreases) the number of available charge carriers, by bringing the relevant charge-carrying band closer to (or further away from) the Fermi level of the channel \cite{sze_semiconductor_devices_2007}.

Threshold Voltage: minimum gate-to-source voltage that is needed to create a conducting path between the electrodes

Quantative measurement of leftward shift in transfer curve
Use minima of curve in reverse sweep direction (more consistent than reading in forward sweep direction)
I compared the transfer characteristics after then rinse steps to the pristine characteristics
Transfer shifts where current drops to zero are excluded (indicates delamination/damage to channel)

Second quantative measurement of leftward shift in transfer curve
Use curve in reverse sweep direction (more consistent than reading in forward sweep direction)
Separate readings for left and right hand sides of transfer curve (left side = electrons dominant carrier, right side = holes dominant carrier)
Transfer shifts where current drops to zero are excluded (indicates delamination/damage to channel)
This gives us a quantitative idea of whether the transfer shifts in slides 5/6 are stable (remain the same/similar after rinse steps)

### Current Sampling

It is important to account for the changes in current that occur during a sensing run that are unrelated to sensing, and try to minimise these changes as much as possible. These changes are due to a variety of causes and can be categorised as various types of noise and baseline drift. (1/f noise paper, heller paper)

### Composition and Chirality

Nanotubes in a network can have semiconducting characteristics (s-CNTs) or metallic characteristics (m-CNTs), depending on their chirality \cite{martel_single-_1998,kong_nanotube_2000}.
