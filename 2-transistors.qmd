## Introduction

## Thin-Film Field-Effect Transistors {#sec-general-FETs}

### Structure and Gating {#sec-gating}

Carbon nanotube network and graphene field-effect transistors (CNTFETs and GFETs) are both examples of a class of transistors called thin-film transistors (TFTs). These transistors are closely related to the commonly-used metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET). However, unlike in MOSFETs, in TFTs the transistor substrate is not used as the channel; instead, current passes through the semiconducting film, which is contacted via conductive source and drain electrodes. This semiconducting film may be a network of carbon nanotubes or layers of graphene [@Sun2013]. 

FETs are unipolar transistors: these transistors only use one type of charge carrier in the conducting channel. For $n$-type conducting channels, these charge carriers are negative electrons, while $p$-type conducting channels use holes, positive charge carriers. The FET consists of a source, a drain, and a gate. The behaviour of carriers in the channel between the source and the drain is controlled capacitively by applied electric fields: hence the term ‘field effect’. A FET contains a potential barrier acting against charge carriers at the junctions between the channel and the contacts, known as ‘Schottky barriers’. These barriers arise because of the Fermi energy difference between the metal contacts and the semiconducting channel, and are characterised by the size of the barrier potential φ$_\textrm{B}$ [@Iijima1991]. Increased barrier size leads to increased resistance between the component materials of the FET [@Zheng2016].

V$_\textrm{ds}$ is the voltage between the source and drain electrodes at either end of the semiconducting channel, and is known as the ‘drain bias’. V$_\textrm{g}$ is the potential beneath the gate, and is known as the ‘gate bias’. The gate is insulated from the semiconducting channel by an oxide layer. I$_\textrm{d}$ is the current that flows through the FET from the source to the drain. The current-voltage plot of I$_\textrm{d}$ against V$_\textrm{g}$ is called the 'transfer characteristic curve' of the FET, while the I-V curve of I$_\textrm{d}$ against V$_\textrm{ds}$ is called the 'source-drain characteristic curve' of the FET.

### Electrical Characterisation

CNTFETs are traditionally *p*-type transistors with positive charge carriers [@Martel1998; @Kong2000], while GFETs are ambipolar [@Ohno2010a]. Applying an gate voltage V$_g$ to the gate of a CNTFET or GFET increases, or decreases, the number of available charge carriers, by bringing the relevant charge-carrying band closer to, or further away from, the Fermi level of the channel [@Sze2006]. An example of both back-gated and liquid-gated transfer characteristics from thin-film transistors are shown in @fig-gating-transfer.

V$_\textrm{g}$ is used to turn the FET on or off. A FET is known as ‘normally-off’ if at zero gate bias the channel conductance is very low, and gate voltage must be applied to make the channel conductive. Conversely, a FET is ‘normally-on’ when the channel is conductive with zero gate bias and must have a gate voltage applied to be turned off. For $p$-type channel FETs, negative Vg brings the valence band closer to the Fermi level, meaning more positive charge carriers are available. Therefore these devices are  made more conductive with a more negative gate bias; an increase in V$_\textrm{g}$ reduces I$_\textrm{d}$. The opposite is true for $n$-type channel devices, where a more positive V$_\textrm{g}$ brings the conduction band closer to the Fermi level, meaning more negative charge carriers are available, making the device more conductive. The increased availability of majority carriers in both cases is known as ‘accumulation’.@fig-accumulation illustrates accumulation in each situation.

![Energy band diagrams for a FET device under accumulation conditions, where the left side of each diagram is the gate region, while the right side is the channel region [@Sze2006].](figures/ch8/accumulation.png){#fig-accumulation width=70%}

An important attribute of the transfer characteristic curve for all thin-film FETs is the on-off current ratio. On-off current ratio is the ratio of the current through a device when gated fully “off” with a positive voltage, to the current through the device when gated fully “on” with a negative voltage [@Zheng2017]. The off current in an ambipolar FET can be defined as the minimum current during the transfer sweep, where the majority carrier transitions from being holes to electrons or vice versa. For example, the on current of the channel shown in @fig-gating-transfer (b) is 741.5 nA, the off current is 0.2 nA, and therefore the on-off ratio is $\sim$ 3000. In contrast, even when 10 V is applied, the backgated device shown in @fig-gating-transfer (a) is never gated fully off. Application of higher voltages to the gate result in significant leakage currents through the gate, and can even result in irreversible breakdown of the oxide layer [@Sze2006]. Being able to traverse both on and off regimes over a limited voltage interval is one of the many advantages of the liquid-gated configuration.

Channel carriers in a FET can be accelerated by a sufficiently high gate-channel field into surmounting the insulating barrier between the gate and channel. This is known as ‘breakdown’. The breakdown voltage V$_\textrm{b}$ gives an upper limit to the bias able to be applied across the device without the device being destroyed. Percolation theory can be used to explain breakdown. As energetic carriers pass through the oxide, defects are created randomly. When these random defects are dense enough to form a chain from the gate to the semiconductor, a short is created and breakdown occurs. With decreased oxide thickness the the required voltage for breakdown also decreases, due to increased carrier tunnelling.

### Current Sampling

It is important to account for the changes in current that occur during a sensing run that are unrelated to sensing, and try to minimise these changes as much as possible. These changes are due to a variety of causes and can be categorised as various types of noise and baseline drift. (1/f noise paper, heller paper)

## Random-Network Carbon Nanotube Field-Effect Transistors

### Composition and Chirality

A single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) consists of a graphene sheet, a flat carbon lattice with hexagonal cells, rolled up into a cylinder. Since their discovery in 1991, a wide range of device applications for carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been proposed, based on CNTs being highly sensitive to their environment [@Iijima1991; @Battie2010; @Boyd2014; @Chen2019]. This high sensitivity is due to the high surface-to-volume ratio of the CNTs, which maximises the exposure of this electrically sensitive structure to its surroundings [@Battie2010]. SWCNT-based devices consume little power, operate quickly and are flexible [@Chen2019]. Nanotubes in a network can have semiconducting characteristics (s-CNTs) or metallic characteristics (m-CNTs), depending on their chirality [@Martel1998; @Kong2000]. A single CNT will therefore have different properties than a network of CNTs, where the individual electrical properties of the CNT tubes are averaged out across the network [@Battie2010].

#### Threshold Voltage {.unnumbered}

The threshold voltage is the voltage required to fully deplete the device channel of charge carriers [@Martel1998].

The FET turns on at the ‘threshold voltage’, V$_\textrm{g}$ = V$_\textrm{t}$. For the $p$-type FET, when V$_\textrm{g}$ > V$_\textrm{t}$, I$_\textrm{d}$ increases linearly.

After decreasing past V$_\textrm{t}$, I$_\textrm{d}$ stays
constant at its ‘on’ value I$_\textrm{ON}$. The ratio of I$_\textrm{ON}$ to the I$_\textrm{OFF}$ current is known as the FET device’s ‘on-off ratio’, I$_\textrm{ON}$/I$_\textrm{OFF}$. The threshold voltage can be calculated by using an FET’s transfer characteristics. From extrapolating
the trendline of the linear region to the V$_\textrm{g}$ axis, the intercept V$_\textrm{gInt}$ is approximately equivalent to V$_\textrm{t}$ [@Sze2006].

Threshold Voltage: minimum gate-to-source voltage that is needed to create a conducting path between the electrodes

Quantative measurement of leftward shift in transfer curve
Use minima of curve in reverse sweep direction (more consistent than reading in forward sweep direction)
I compared the transfer characteristics after then rinse steps to the pristine characteristics
Transfer shifts where current drops to zero are excluded (indicates delamination/damage to channel)

Second quantative measurement of leftward shift in transfer curve
Use curve in reverse sweep direction (more consistent than reading in forward sweep direction)
Separate readings for left and right hand sides of transfer curve (left side = electrons dominant carrier, right side = holes dominant carrier)
Transfer shifts where current drops to zero are excluded (indicates delamination/damage to channel)
This gives us a quantitative idea of whether the transfer shifts in slides 5/6 are stable (remain the same/similar after rinse steps)
