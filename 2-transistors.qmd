# Carbon Nanotube and Graphene Field-Effect Transistors

## Introduction

Out of a wide range of available transducer options available for the creation of compact, portable and highly-integrated biosensors, field-effect transistors are among the most promising. Field-effect transistors, initially proposed in the 1930s, consist of two conductive electrodes on either side of a semiconducting channel, the 'source' and 'drain' electrodes, alongside an isolated 'gate' electrode which is typically perpendicular to the channel. An applied electric field from the gate electrode capacitively controls channel resistance, giving rise to the label 'field-effect'. By adjusting gate voltage, the flow of charge carriers between source and drain can be varied over several orders of magnitude. The ability of this simple structure to obtain a large signal response from small changes in channel behaviour means field-effect transistors can be used as high-quality amplifiers for sensor applications [@Petti2016; @Tran2016; @Shkodra2021; @Yao2021]. Generally, field-effect transistors are unipolar transistors; channel conduction either mainly consists of electron carriers, or hole carriers, depending on the electrode and channel materials used [@Yao2021].

Carbon nanotube network and graphene field-effect transistors (CNTFETs and GFETs) are both examples of a class of field-effect transistors called thin-film transistors (TFTs). These transistors, first developed in 1962 [@Weimer1962], are closely related to the commonly-used metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET). Unlike MOSFETs, thin-film transistors do not use the substrate as the device channel. Instead, current passes through a semiconducting film on the surface of the device;the films discussed here are graphene and carbon nanotubes, two carbon-based low-dimension nanomaterials. Since thin-film transistors do not require a conductive substrate, they can be fabricated using light, flexible and stretchable substrates, making them significantly more versatile than MOSFETs [@Sun2013; @Petti2016; @Shkodra2021]. While the principle of modulating current with a gate electrode is shared by the MOSFET and TFT, the underlying physics behind the transistor behaviour differs between the two. The MOSFET is turned on by the change in carrier behaviour when switching from an depletion to an inversion mode, while this is not the case for a TFT [@Petti2016]. Details of graphene and carbon nanotube TFT switching behaviours can be found in the subsequent sections.

## Thin-Film Field-Effect Transistors {#sec-general-FETs}

### Structure and Gating {#sec-gating}

The basic components of the thin-film transistor can be configured in a number of different ways. Two of these configurations are the back-gated field-effect transistor and the liquid-gated (or electrolyte-gated) transistor. The relatively simple back-gated configuration, shown in @fig-gating-schematics (a), uses the degenerately doped silicon substrate as the gate. The channel is isolated from the gate with a thin silicon dioxide layer. A liquid-gated device, shown in @fig-gating-schematics (b), is used for sensitive analyte detection in liquid-phase. In the most common form of this configuration, a submerged Ag/AgCl reference electrode is used as a top-gate. The channel is isolated from the gate by the bulk of an electrolyte solution, typically the biofriendly phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Other aqueous salt solutions, polymers and ion-gels are also sometimes used as the electrolyte gate. The electrolyte is restricted to the channel area using a hydrophobic PDMS microchamber, referred to here as a 'PDMS well' [@Avouris2007; @Shkodra2021; @Tran2016; @Li2023].

:::

Two different voltages are used to adjust transistor operation. The first is the 'drain bias', $V_{ds}$, between the drain and source electrodes, and the second is the 'gate bias', $V_g$, applied between the gate and source electrode. The value of $V_g$ determines how charge carriers flow under the influence of $V_{ds}$ to produce a drain-source current $I_d$. The relative effect of changes in $V_g$ on source-drain current $I_d$ is determined by gate capacitance, which is a series combination of the geometric capacitance, $C_{G}$, and the quantum capacitance of the channel nanomaterial, $C_{Q}$. For a back-gated device, geometric capacitance is predominantly due to the oxide layer capacitance $C_{ox}$ [@Avouris2007; @Heller2009a; @Tran2016; @Li2023]. In an ambipolar transistor, a highly negative $V_g$ will give rise to hole conduction, and a highly positive $V_g$ will give rise to electron conduction[@Avouris2007; @Yao2021; @Li2023]. When $|V_{ds}| < |V_g| - |V_t|$ and the device is gated on, the device is in the linear regime. In this regime, $V_{ds}$ is directly proportional to $I_{d}$, similar to an Ohmic resistor. When $|V_{ds}| > |V_g| - |V_t|$ and the device is on, the device is in the saturation regime, where the relationship between $V_{ds}$ and $I_{d}$ becomes non-linear [@Petti2016; @Shkodra2021].

#### Liquid-Gating and Debye Length {.unnumbered}

![A diagram of the formation of an electric double layer (EDL) under an applied voltage between source and liquid-gate electrodes, with a $p$-type semiconductor used for the channel thin-film. Electric double layers are present at both the gate-electrolyte interface and semiconductor-electrolyte interface. Adapted from [@Ohno2015; @Shkodra2021; @Tiwari2022].](figures/ch2/Debye-length-schematic.png){#fig-Debye-length width="60%"}

Understanding the ionic behaviour of the gate electrolyte used in a liquid-gated device setup gives insight into the gating and sensing behaviour of the setup. When a voltage is applied at the liquid-gate, the charged ions in solution move to form two electric double layers, one at the interface between the electrolyte and gate electrode, and one at the interface between electrolyte and semiconducting channel, as shown in @fig-Debye-length. The gate capacitance is a series combination of the capacitance of each EDL in series with quantum capacitance $C_{Q}$ [@Heller2010; @Shkodra2021]. The Gouy-Chapman-Stern model splits the EDL into two distinct regions, the first being a compact layer of ions, the Stern layer, and the second being a more diffuse layer, the Gouy-Chapman layer [@Tiwari2022]. The surface potential of the solid-electrolyte interface exponentially decreases across the diffuse region of the double-layer; the characteristic length of this potential screening is known as Debye length, $\lambda_D$. The typical electrolyte Debye length is on a nanometer scale, therefore the bulk electrolyte acts as an insulator, similar to the silicon dioxide dielectric in the back-gated configuration. The Stern layer capacitance is inversely proportional to the Debye length, and therefore decreased $\lambda_D$ corresponds to increased gate capacitance [@Heller2010; @Ohno2015; @Shkodra2021; @Yao2021].

$$
\lambda_D = \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_0\epsilon_rk_bT}{2N_Aq^2I}}
$$ {#eq-debye-length}

The equation for Debye length $\lambda_D$ in an electrolyte solution is given by @eq-debye-length, where $\epsilon_0$ is vacuum permittivity, $\epsilon_r$ is the relative permittivity of the electrolyte, $\k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is absolute temperature in K, $N_A$ is the Avogadro number, $q$ is the elementary charge and $I$ is ionic strength in mmol L$^{-1}$. When temperature is kept constant, $\lambda_D$ only depends on the ionic strength of the electrolyte and not on any attributes of the gate electrode or channel. Successive dilutions of a particular electrolyte will increase the Debye length: for $1 \times$ PBS, $\lambda_D$ is 0.7 nm, for $0.1 \times$ PBS, $\lambda_D$ is 2.3 nm, for $0.01 \times$ PBS $\lambda_D$ is 7.3 nm and so on. This means gate capacitance is directly dependent on the electrolyte used and its concentration. A $1 \times$ PBS electrolyte gives a gate capacitance several orders of magnitude larger than that of a silicon oxide back-gate. A larger capacitance significantly increases the effect of electrostatic gating on the channel current, often described as increased electrostatic coupling between gate and channel. A liquid-gated device with low Debye length will therefore be highly sensitive to electrostatic changes across a small voltage range [@Heller2010; @Wang2010; @Ohno2015; @Shkodra2021; @Yao2021]. 

However, a decreased Debye length also has disadvantages for sensing. Electrostatic potentials outside of the electrolyte-channel electrical double layer are effectively screened from the channel. Electrical double layers will also form around charged biomolecules such as DNA present within the solution. The combined screening effect means signals due to potential changes in charged biomolecules within the bulk electrolyte will have no effect on gating of the channel, and therefore no effect on $I_d$. Interactions between the analyte and any biorecognition element must therefore occur within the Debye length, and so a tradeoff exists between channel sensitivity and the size of the sensitive region above the channel. Many medium or large proteins will require a relatively dilute electrolyte for analyte capture to be detected by the channel, which may not reflect the intended environment for biosensor application [@Stern2007; @Piccinini2018; @Shkodra2021]. Other approaches to increasing Debye length without reducing device sensitivity have therefore also been trialled. One approach involves attaching a layer of polyethylene glycol polymer (PEG) to the channel, limiting the approach of counterions. This increases Debye length at the electrolyte-channel interface while preserving the capacitance of the electrolyte-gate interface, keeping device sensitivity relatively high [@Gao2016; @Kesler2020].

### Electrical Characterisation

Both carbon nanotube field effect transistors and graphene field-effect transistors are naturally ambipolar. Applying a gate voltage $V_g$ to the gate of an ambipolar thin-film transistor influences the amount and type of available charge carriers for conduction [@Avouris2007; @Tran2016; @Heller2009a]. The current-voltage plots for a given transistor are known as the 'characteristic curves' of the transistor. The plot of $I_d$ against $V_g$ at constant $V_{ds}$ is known as the 'transfer' characteristic curve at that source-drain voltage, while the I-V curve of $I_d$ against $V_{ds}$ at constant $V_g$ is known as the 'source-drain' or 'output' characteristic curve at that gate voltage [@Petti2016; @Shkodra2021]. The transfer characteristics are governed by the gate capacitance, as discussed in @sec-gating. Both back-gated and liquid-gated transfer characteristics from ambipolar thin-film transistors are shown in @fig-gating-transfer. Taking regular transfer measurements of a graphene or carbon nanotube device is not only useful in building a complete picture of device behaviour, but also may help to ensure devices are kept highly sensitive to electrostatic gating effects through redistributing charge in the channel [@Noyce2019].

A variety of quantitative parameters can be extracted from the transfer characteristics of a thin-film transistor. A more comprehensive list and derivation of these characteristics can be found in the thin-film transistor study by Petti *et al.* [@Petti2016]. The parameters of particular interest here are transconductance, on-off ratio, threshold voltage and subthreshold swing. Transconductance and on-off ratio are discussed below, while threshold voltage and subthreshold swing are discussed for the carbon nanotube network case specifically in @sec-electrical-characterisation-CNT. Other behaviours observed when measuring currents present in a thin-film device are also discussed below, including source-gate leakage current and the hysteresis and real-time signal drift of source-drain current.

Examples of field-effect transistor transfer characteristics taken at $V_{ds}$ = 100 mV from two different device channels. A linear scale is used in (a) and (b), while a logarithmic scale is used in (c) and (d). The curves in (a) and (c) are from backgated channels, while the curves in (b) and (d) are from liquid-gated channels. The linear fit with gradient corresponding to transconductance at $V_g$ = 0 V is shown in (a) and (b) with a dotted red line. The "on" current in (c) and (d) is shown with a red horizontal line, while the "off" current in (d) is shown with a blue horizontal line. 
:::

#### Transconductance {.unnumbered}

In the linear regime, transconductance at a specific gate voltage is given by $g_m = |dI_{d}/dV_g|$. Transconductance indicates how responsive the device is to electrostatic gating at a given gate voltage. In other words, when $g_m$ is large, small changes in $V_g$ can significantly modulate channel current $I_d$, which is useful for sensing [@Heller2009a; @Ohno2015]. Transconductance at a given gate voltage is also proportional to the mobility of charge carriers in the device channel [@Petti2016; @Zheng2017; @Li2023]. The transconductance at a specific gate voltage can be found from performing a linear fit in a small region around that voltage on the transfer curve. Linear fits for transconductance at $V_g = 0$ V are shown for a back-gated device in @fig-gating-transfer (a), and a liquid-gated device in @fig-gating-transfer (b), which give values of $g_m = 5 \times 10^{-8} S$ and $g_m = 100 \times 10^{-8} S$ respectively. The difference of several orders of magnitude between back-gated and liquid-gated transconductance corresponds to the difference of several orders of magnitude between back and liquid-gated gate capacitance [@Tran2016; @Shkodra2021]. Improved transconductance is therefore a significant advantage of the use of the liquid-gate.

#### On-off Ratio {.unnumbered}

Another important attribute of the transfer characteristic curve for all thin-film FETs is the on-off current ratio. On-off current ratio is the ratio of the current through a device when gated fully 'off' with a positive voltage, to the current through the device when gated fully 'on' with a negative voltage. The off current in an ambipolar FET can be defined as the minimum current during the transfer sweep, where the majority carrier transitions from being holes to electrons or *vice versa* [@Petti2016; @Zheng2017]. For example, the on current of the channel shown in @fig-gating-transfer (b) is 741.5 nA, the off current is 0.2 nA, and therefore the on-off ratio is $\sim$ 3000. In contrast, even when 10 V is applied, the backgated device shown in @fig-gating-transfer (a) is never gated fully off. Being able to traverse both on and off regimes over a limited voltage interval is another advantage of the liquid-gated configuration. The on-off ratio of a device can be used as a rough but useful indication of the type of switching or transconductance behaviour that a device exhibits, with the advantage of being relatively simple to both find and display.

#### Gate Leakage {.unnumbered}

Forward and reverse sweeps are shown for the back-gated case (a) and the liquid-gated case (b), with the direction of each sweep indicated by an arrow. A sweep rate of $V_{ds}$ = 100 mV/sample was used for the back-gated device and a sweep rate of $V_{ds}$ = 10 mV/sample was used for the liquid-gate device. The gate current measured during each sweep is also shown with a dotted line.
:::

Application of higher voltages to the gate in both the liquid-gate and back-gate cases can result in significant leakage currents through the gate. These currents mean that the insulating layer at the gate producing the capacitive effect no longer acts as an insulator, adversely affecting transistor quality [@Noyce2019; @Shkodra2021]. In the case of back-gated devices, gate leakage occurs due to conduction through the oxide dielectric. If the gate voltage produces an electric field exceeding the dielectric strength of the oxide, dielectric breakdown can occur, where the oxide layer no longer acts as an insulator. Breakdown results from voltage-induced oxygen vacancies in the SiO$_2$ lattice forming a conductive path through the insulator [@Padovani2017]. In the liquid-gated case, the choice of electrolyte determines the appropriate voltage range for electrical characterisation, since excessive voltages will drive electrolysis and induce redox reactions. For water-based electrolytes, gate voltages must be kept within the $\pm$ 1 V range [@Wang2010; @Ohno2015; @Shkodra2021]. In normal operation, gate current should appear negligible on a linear scale for both the back-gated and liquid-gated cases, as shown in @fig-gating-hysteresis.

#### Hysteresis and Baseline Drift {.unnumbered}

Thin-film transistor devices typically exhibit some degree of hysteresis, where the history of channel current affects future current behaviour. Hysteresis in carbon nanotube and graphene field-effect transistors is a result of filling or emptying of slow-discharge charge traps in the local environment of the channel. These charge traps exist either within the silicon dioxide insulator or at its interface with the channel, typically due to adsorbed water [@Kim2003; @Wang2010]. A capacitive gating effect from charged ions also contributes to hysteresis, either due to the use of a electrolyte-gated environment or from charged surface contamination [@Wang2010]. Due to hysteresis, sweeping $V_g$ forwards across a set voltage range will result in a different $I_d - V_g$ characteristic curve than if $V_g$ is subsequently swept in the reverse direction over that same range. Hysteresis depends on the voltage range used for characterisation, the sweep rate and the environment of the transistor channel [@Kim2003; @Wang2010]. The difference between the forward and reverse sweep for both the back-gated and liquid-gated case is illustrated in @fig-gating-hysteresis. The hysteresis is significantly lower for the liquid-gated case, which may be explained by the reduced voltage range and sweep rate. However, the electrolyte layer may also prevent atmospheric adsorbents reaching the channel, further reducing hysteresis.

Memory effects are also present during current measurement when both source-drain and source-gate voltages are kept constant. These changes appear as a slow change in current, referred to here as either signal drift or baseline drift. In more extreme cases, baseline drift can obscure or even be confused with current changes attributable to analyte interaction during real-time sensing. Noyce *et al.* found that for carbon nanotube devices biased with $V_g = -15$ V, a period of steep signal drift was observed, which settled into a stable steady-state after $\sim$ 3 hours. It appears the signal drift, which occurred both in air and under vacuum conditions, was a result of trap states being filled in a manner that could be modelled using a sum of three exponentials. Changes in room temperature and ambient lighting were also found to contribute to signal noise and drift behaviours via separate mechanisms, but these contributions are relatively small. When numerous drift measurements were taken of the same device, even though the initial and final current values differed significantly between measurements, very similar settling behaviour was observed, indicating signal drift behaviour is reversible and characteristic of a particular channel [@Noyce2019]. 

As noted by Noyce *et al.*, the high demand for characterisation equipment in a standard device laboratory means that waiting over three hours for baseline drift to settle is impractical, and furthermore, extended periods of voltage application may degrade bio-functionalised devices. Since trap states are unavoidable to a degree [@DiMaria1993; @Collins2000], data analysis that accounts for baseline drift was therefore explored in some detail in this thesis.

## Graphene Field-Effect Transistors

### Graphene Properties

Graphene is a 2-dimensional material which consists of strongly sp$^2$-bonded carbon atoms in a dense lattice of hexagonal cells [@Novoselov2004; @Geim2007; @Tran2016]. Graphene can be used to create a variety of low-dimensional graphitic nanomaterials, including carbon nanotubes (see @sec-carbon-nanotubes). Monolayer and bilayer graphene are zero band gap semiconductors, as their conduction and valence bands touch at the Fermi level. Adding more graphene layers adds more complexity to the electronic bandstructure, with significant overlap between bands and reduced carrier mobility. When 10 or more layers are present, the structure behaves as 3D graphite [@Geim2007; @Ohno2015]. First isolated in 2004 [@Novoselov2004], monolayer graphene has many desirable electronic properties. Charge carrier transport is ballistic over submicrometer distances at room temperature, and as graphene is metallic even at the Dirac point, this transport is not inhibited by a Schottky barrier at the metal contacts of a device [@Novoselov2004; @Geim2007]. Graphene is also a highly chemically stable material. In particular, it will not readily oxidise in an electrolyte solution due to having a large 'electrochemical window'; in other words, it is too chemically stable to take part in electrochemical reactions within a large range of applied voltages [@Ohno2015; @Tran2016].

#### Graphene Folds {.unnumbered}

Vertical warping on the scale of tens of nanometers helps to stablise the graphene layer, increasing elastic energy but reducing the thermal vibrations which are large in a 2D material [@Geim2007].

Liquid-gated transfer characteristics of two graphene field-effect transistor channels. In (a), the Dirac point voltage is indicated by a red dotted line, and regions of hole conduction and electron conduction are also shown. The relative Fermi energy in each region is shown on graphene bandstructure insets (adapted from [@Geim2007; @Ohno2015]). The graphene channel in (b) has double conduction minima, which are highlighted with red arrows.
:::

When a gate voltage $V_g$ is applied to the channel of a graphene device, the Fermi energy is shifted and surface charge density is altered [@Novoselov2004; @Heller2010; @Ohno2015]. An increase in available charge means an increase in carriers available for conduction and increased $I_d$ [@Geim2007]. 




The transfer sweep behaviour is that of an ambipolar semiconductor, except there is no characteristic 'off' regime. The minimum conductance obtainable by gating occurs at what is known as the neutrality or Dirac point, where the population of charge carriers is at a minimum [@Novoselov2004; @Ohno2015]. At voltages close to the Dirac voltage, a mixed state exists where both electrons and holes are present. As gate voltage moves left away from the Dirac voltage, holes begin to dominate conduction, while when gate voltage is moved to the right of the Dirac voltage, electrons dominate [@Novoselov2004].

As gate voltage is increased or decreased away from the Dirac voltage, conductivity increases linearly [@Novoselov2004]. Typically, a monolayer graphene channel will conduct holes at zero gate voltage, which is due to the presence of atmospheric dopants such as water. By removing these dopants, the Dirac point feature can be brought closer to the zero gate voltage position on the transfer curve, indicating graphene is naturally a mixed-carrier conductor [@Novoselov2004]. 

The on-off ratio of the graphene transfer curve shown is 5. As graphene lacks a bandgap, there is a minimum possible conductance for graphene devices, which leads to a relatively small on-off ratio [@Novoselov2004; @Geim2007]. This attribute is a drawback of the graphene FET in sensing applications when compared with carbon nanotube transistors [@Novoselov2004]. 

while the Dirac voltage is 0.29 V.

### Sensing Mechanisms

Graphene and carbon nanotube-based thin-film transistors are often utilised in biological sensing applications. The large surface-to-volume ratio of the nanomaterials makes them highly sensitive to intermolecular interactions [@Tran2016; @Yao2021; @Shkodra2021]. An analyte molecule can be detected using a graphene channel by observing the change in current that occurs when a charged analyte alters the channel Fermi level [@Heller2010; @Ohno2015]. 

## Random-Network Carbon Nanotube Field-Effect Transistors

### Carbon Nanotube Properties {#sec-carbon-nanotubes}

A single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) consists of a graphene sheet, a flat carbon lattice with hexagonal cells, rolled up into a cylinder. Since their discovery in 1991, a wide range of device applications for carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been proposed, based on CNTs being highly sensitive to their environment [@Iijima1991; @Dekker1999]. Like graphene, carbon nanotubes have a large potential window, and are therefore not readily oxidised in a liquid-gate environment [@Ohno2015].


 Nanotubes in a network can have semiconducting characteristics (s-CNTs) or metallic characteristics (m-CNTs), depending on their chirality [@Martel1998; @Kong2000]. A single CNT will therefore have different properties than a network of CNTs, where the individual electrical properties of the CNT tubes are averaged out across the network [@Battie2010]. The contact between the electrodes and carbon nanotubes determines the behaviour of channel carriers. The properties of electrodes generally used in CNT FETs means they usually operate as $p$-type transistors [@Yao2021].

 

Able to conduct ballistically, good coupling between gate and channel electric fields with carbon nanotube devices which enables shorter channel sizes [@Avouris2007] carbon nanotube devices in the electrolyte-gated layout have stronger channel-gate coupling than the back-gated layout [@Heller2009a]

Semiconducting carbon nanotubes have particular advantages for use in sensor applications, including a high carrier mobility, compatibility with many biological targets, and ease of processing [@Shkodra2021].




### Carbon Nanotube Networks 

When the source and drain electrodes of a thin-film field-effect transistor are made of metal, a Schottky barrier forms between the channel and the electrodes. The Schottky barrier results from a difference in the work function between the metal and semiconducting channel, leading to bending of the conduction and valence bands and the formation of an electric dipole layer at the junction. Due to the absence of metal-channel bonding, the metal used has a direct impact on barrier height $\phi_B$ [@Avouris2007; @Li2023]. The spatial extent of the dipole layer is called the barrier thickness. For unipolar transistors, where the Schottky barrier is thick, the channel-electrode contact determines the type of charge carrier passing between source and drain. A contact which forms a low Schottky barrier for holes will form a high Schottky barrier for electrons. In this case, holes flow and the device is $p$-type. The reverse applies for a contact with a high Schottky barrier for holes, where electrons flow and the device is $n$-type. Thin-film devices can also be ambipolar, where charge carriers can quantum-mechanically tunnel through thin Schottky barriers and electrons and holes can both flow through the channel [@Avouris2007; @Heller2008; @Shkodra2021; @Yao2021].

The subthreshold slope is shown with a black dotted line, while the threshold voltages are shown with red dotted lines. The ON and OFF regimes are also indicated on both figures.
:::

Like graphene transistors, carbon nanotube transistors are naturally ambipolar: they can conduct both electrons and holes. Holes travel at highly negative voltages, while electrons travel at highly positive voltages. At intermediary voltages, both electrons and holes flow. Carbon nanotube transistors can also be doped into behaving as a unipolar transistor [@Avouris2007]. If heavily oxygen doped, the semiconducting carbon nanotubes will exhibit $p$-type behaviour, with current flow only occuring in a negative bias state [@Shkodra2021].

Changing $V_g$ alters the energy band bending at the channel-electrode junctions, and therefore also alters the energy barriers at these junctions.

; in other words, $V_g$ determines whether the transistor is 'on' or 'off'

In a liquid-gated environment, gate leakage currents may approach that of the carbon nanotube channel drain current, especially if the network used is sparse. This can lead to significant device noise. The relative prominence of liquid-gate leakage current when using sparse carbon nanotube FETs therefore means using a dense network or a graphene device can give enhanced signal-to-noise ratio during sensing [@Ohno2015].


#### Threshold Voltage {.unnumbered}

The threshold voltage $V_t$ is the gate voltage required to increase the Schottky barrier height to a point where charge carriers no longer flow. For a $p$-type semiconductor channel, increasing $V_g$ towards positive gate voltages will raise the Schottky barrier and turn current off, with the opposite being true for an $n$-type channel.  There are therefore two threshold voltages for these devices, $V_{t,h}$ and $V_{t,e}$. Within the range between these gate voltages, both holes and electrons flow through the channel [@Avouris2007; @Reiner-Rozman2015; @Yao2021; @Li2023]. 


The threshold voltage is the voltage required to fully deplete the device channel of charge carriers [@Martel1998]. It can be estimated by extrapolating the linear part of the transfer characteristics of a device to the $V_g$ axis.

The FET turns on at the ‘threshold voltage’, $V_g$ = $V_t$. For the $p$-type FET, when $V_g$ > $V_t$, $I_d$ increases linearly.

After decreasing past $V_t$, $I_d$ stays
constant at its ‘on’ value $I_{ON}$. The ratio of $I_{ON}$ to the $I_{OFF}$ current is known as the FET device’s ‘on-off ratio’, $I_{ON}/I_{OFF}$. The threshold voltage can be calculated by using an FET’s transfer characteristics. From extrapolating
the trendline of the linear region to the $V_g$ axis, the intercept $V_{gInt}$ is approximately equivalent to $V_t$ [@Sze2006].

$V_t$ can be estimated by extrapolating the linear region of the transfer characteristics of a device to the $V_g$ axis. The value for $V_g$ at this intercept is approximately equal to $V_t$ when $V_{ds}$ is close to zero [@Sze2006]. It should be noted that it is difficult to relate this estimate for $V_t$ for thin-film field-effect transistors to carrier density directly. Instead, the value found for $V_t$ should be considered as a useful parameter for comparing the gating behaviour of different devices [@Schoonveld2001].

Threshold Voltage: minimum gate-to-source voltage that is needed to create a conducting path between the electrodes

Quantative measurement of leftward shift in transfer curve
Use minima of curve in reverse sweep direction (more consistent than reading in forward sweep direction)
I compared the transfer characteristics after then rinse steps to the pristine characteristics
Transfer shifts where current drops to zero are excluded (indicates delamination/damage to channel)

Second quantative measurement of leftward shift in transfer curve
Use curve in reverse sweep direction (more consistent than reading in forward sweep direction)
Separate readings for left and right hand sides of transfer curve (left side = electrons dominant carrier, right side = holes dominant carrier)
Transfer shifts where current drops to zero are excluded (indicates delamination/damage to channel)
This gives us a quantitative idea of whether the transfer shifts in slides 5/6 are stable (remain the same/similar after rinse steps)

### Sensing Mechanisms

For semiconducting carbon nanotube field-effect transistor devices, sensing mechanisms include electrostatic gating, partial charge transfer, Schottky barrier modulation, capacitance modulation and charge scattering. Response mechanisms may take place at the gate, the junctions between channel and contact, or at the semiconductor channel [@Heller2008; @Tran2016; @Li2023]. Modification of the channel-metal Schottky barrier can dominate sensing activity, and this can complicate the identification of mechanisms underlying the sensing behaviour [@Schroeder2019]. The encapsulation layer shown in @fig-gating-schematics is added to separate the electrodes from the channel-metal junction and prevent these responses [@Heller2008; @Shkodra2021]. The predominant sensing mechanism is then either charge transfer from the analyte to channel [@Allen2007] or electrostatic gating [@Heller2008]. The charge transfer mechanism involves direct addition of charge carriers to the channel, while the gating mechanism results from the presence of a charge near the channel inducing an opposite polarity charge in the channel. Both changes alter the relationship between $V_g$ and $I_d$ and shift the carrier threshold voltages [@Tran2016; @Shkodra2021].
