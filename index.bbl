      \field{abstract}{The way in which organisms detect specific volatile compounds within their environment, and the associated neural processing which produces perception and subsequent behavioural responses, have been of interest to scientists for decades. Initially, most olfaction research was conducted using electrophysiological techniques on whole animals. However, the discovery of genes encoding the family of human olfactory receptors (ORs) paved the way for the development of a range of cellular assays, primarily used to deorphan ORs from mammals and insects. These assays have greatly advanced our knowledge of the molecular basis of olfaction, however, while there is currently good agreement on vertebrate and nematode olfactory signalling cascades, debate still surrounds the signalling mechanisms in insects. The inherent specificity and sensitivity of ORs makes them prime candidates as biological detectors of volatile ligands within biosensor devices, which have many potential applications. In the previous decade, researchers have investigated various technologies for transducing OR:ligand interactions into a readable format and thereby produce an olfactory biosensor (or bioelectronic nose) that maintains the discriminating power of the ORs in vivo. Here we review and compare the molecular mechanisms of olfaction in vertebrates and invertebrates, and also summarise the assay technologies utilising sub-tissue level sensing elements (cells and cell extracts), which have been applied to OR deorphanisation and biosensor research. Although there are currently no commercial, "field-ready" olfactory biosensors of the kind discussed here, there have been several technological proof-of-concept studies suggesting that we will see their emergence within the next decade. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.}

      \field{abstract}{Human sensory-mimicking systems, such as electronic brains, tongues, skin, and ears, have been promoted for use in improving social welfare. However, no significant achievements have been made in mimicking the human nose due to the complexity of olfactory sensory neurons. Combinational coding of human olfactory receptors (hORs) is essential for odorant discrimination in mixtures, and the development of hOR-combined multiplexed systems has progressed slowly. Here, we report the first demonstration of an artificial multiplexed superbioelectronic nose (MSB-nose) that mimics the human olfactory sensory system, leading to high-performance odorant discriminatory ability in mixtures. Specifically, portable MSB-noses were constructed using highly uniform graphene micropatterns (GMs) that were conjugated with two different hORs, which were employed as transducers in a liquid-ion gated field-effect transistor (FET). Field-induced signals from the MSB-nose were monitored and provided high sensitivity and selectivity toward target odorants (minimum detectable level: 0.1 fM). More importantly, the potential of the MSB-nose as a tool to encode hOR combinations was demonstrated using principal component analysis.}

      \field{abstract}{A bioelectronic nose, an intelligent chemical sensor array system coupled with bio-receptors to identify gases and vapours, resembles mammalian olfaction by which many vertebrates can sniff out volatile organic compounds (VOCs) sensitively and specifically even at very low concentrations. Olfaction is undertaken by the olfactory system, which detects odorants that are inhaled through the nose where they come into contact with the olfactory epithelium containing olfactory receptors (ORs). Because of its ability to mimic biological olfaction, a bio-inspired electronic nose has been used to detect a variety of important compounds in complex environments. Recently, biosensor systems have been introduced that combine nanoelectronic technology and olfactory receptors themselves as a source of capturing elements for biosensing. In this article, we will present the latest advances in bioelectronic nose technology mimicking the olfactory system, including biological recognition elements, emerging detection systems, production and immobilization of sensing elements on sensor surface, and applications of bioelectronic noses. Furthermore, current research trends and future challenges in this field will be discussed.}

      \field{abstract}{Artificial olfactory sensors that recognize patterns transmitted by olfactory receptors are emerging as a technology for monitoring volatile organic compounds. Advances in statistical processing methods and data processing technology have made it possible to classify patterns in sensor arrays. Moreover, biomimetic olfactory recognition sensors in the form of pattern recognition have been developed. Deep learning and artificial intelligence technologies have enabled the classification of pattern data from more sensor arrays, and improved artificial olfactory sensor technology is being developed with the introduction of artificial neural networks. An example of an artificial olfactory sensor is the electronic nose. It is an array of various types of sensors, such as metal oxides, electrochemical sensors, surface acoustic waves, quartz crystal microbalances, organic dyes, colorimetric sensors, conductive polymers, and mass spectrometers. It can be tailored depending on the operating environment and the performance requirements of the artificial olfactory sensor. This review compiles artificial olfactory sensor technology based on olfactory mechanisms. We introduce the mechanisms of artificial olfactory sensors and examples used in food quality and stability assessment, environmental monitoring, and diagnostics. Although current artificial olfactory sensor technology has several limitations and there is limited commercialization owing to reliability and standardization issues, there is considerable potential for developing this technology. Artificial olfactory sensors are expected to be widely used in advanced pattern recognition and learning technologies, along with advanced sensor technology in the future.}

      \field{abstract}{The year 2008 marks the 10th anniversary of the carbon nanotube field-effect transistor (NTFET). In the past decade a vast amount of effort has been placed on the development of NTFET based sensors for the detection of both chemical and biological species. Towards this end, NTFETs show great promise because of their extreme environmental sensitivity, small size, and ultra-low power requirements. Despite the great progress NTFETs have shown in the field of biological sensing, debate still exists over the mechanistic origins underlying the electronic response of NTFET devices, specifically whether analyte species interact with the carbon nanotube conduction channel or if interaction with the NTFET electrodes actually triggers device response. In this tutorial review, we describe the fabrication of NTFET devices, and detail several reports that illustrate recent advances in biological detection using NTFET devices, while highlighting the suggested mechanisms explaining the device response to analyte species. In doing this we hope to show that NTFET technology has the potential for low-cost and portable bioanalytical platforms.}

      \field{abstract}{Lab-on-a-chip technology offers an ideal platform for low-cost, reliable, and easy-to-use diagnostics of key biomarkers needed for early screening of diseases and other health concerns. In this work, a graphene field-effect transistor (GFET) functionalized with target-binding aptamers is used as a biosensor for the detection of thrombin protein biomarker. Furthermore, this GFET is integrated with a microfluidic device for enhanced sensing performances in terms of detection limit, sensitivity, and continuous monitoring. Under this platform, a picomolar limit of detection was achieved for measuring thrombin; in our experiment measured as low as 2.6 pM. FTIR, Raman and UV-Vis spectroscopy measurements were performed to confirm the device functionalization steps. Based on the concentration-dependent calibration curve, a dissociation constant of KD = 375.8 pM was obtained. Continuous real-time measurements were also conducted under a constant gate voltage (VGS) to observe the transient response of the sensor when analyte was introduced to the device. The target selectivity of the sensor platform was evaluated and confirmed by challenging the GFET biosensor with various concentrations of lysozyme protein. The results suggest that this device technology has the potential to be used as a general diagnostic platform for measuring clinically relevant biomarkers for point-of-care applications.}

      \field{abstract}{Nowadays, there is a high demand for sensitive and selective real-time analytical methods suitable for a wide range of applications, from personalized telemedicine, drug discovery, food safety, and quality control, to defense, security, as well as environmental monitoring. Biosensors are analytical devices able to detect bio-chemical analytes (e.g., neurotransmitters, cancer biomarkers, bio-molecules, and ions), through the combination of a bio-recognition element and a bio-transduction device. The use of customized bio-recognition elements such as enzymes, antibodies, aptamers, and ion-selective membranes facilitates achieving high selectivity. Among the different bio-transduction devices currently available, electrolyte-gated field-effect transistors, in which the dielectric is represented by an ionic liquid buffer solution containing the targeted analyte, are gaining increasing attention. Indeed, these bio-transduction devices are characterized by superior electronic properties and intrinsic signal amplification that allow the detection of a wide range of bio-molecules with high sensitivity (down to pM concentration). A promising semiconducting material for bio-transduction devices is represented by carbon nanotubes, due to their unique electrical properties, nanosize, bio-compatibility, and their simple low-cost processability. This work provides a comprehensive and critical review of electrolyte-gated carbon nanotube field-effect transistor-based biosensors. First, an introduction to these bio-sensing devices is given. Next, the device configurations and operating principles are presented, and the most used materials and processes are reviewed with a particular focus on carbon nanotubes as the active material. Subsequently, different functionalization strategies reported in the literature, based on enzymes, antibodies, aptamers, and ion-selective membranes, are analyzed critically. Finally, present issues and challenges faced in the area are investigated, the conclusions are drawn, and a perspective outlook over the field of bio-sensing technologies, in general, is provided.}

      \field{abstract}{In this study, a highly sensitive and selective biochemical gas sensor (bio-sniffer) and real-time monitoring system with skin gas cell was constructed for the determination of ethanol gas concentration on human skin. This bio-sniffer measured the concentration of ethanol according to the change in fluorescence intensity of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), which is produced in an enzymatic reaction by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). The NADH detection system used an ultraviolet light emitting diode (UV–LED) as the excitation light, and a highly sensitive photomultiplier tube as a fluorescence intensity detector. The calibration range of the ethanol bio-sniffer was validated from 25 ppb﻿ to 128 ppm﻿. To measure the concentration of ethanol within skin gas, subjects ingested an alcohol beverage, and the sensor output was monitored. We chose the central part of the palm, a back of the hand, and a wrist as targets. The real-time concentration of skin ethanol gas at each target was measured after drinking. The maximum output values were reached at approximately 70 min after drinking and then gradually decreased. We showed that ethanol release kinetics were different depending on the part of the hand measured with the developed monitoring system. Accordingly, this highly sensitive and selective bio-sniffer with a skin gas cell could be used to measure ethanol on the skin surface and could be applied for breath and skin gas research, as well as investigation of volatile blood compounds used as biomarkers for clinical diagnosis.}

      \field{abstract}{Cadaverine (CV), a death-associated odor, is an important target molecule for various sensor applications, including the evaluation of food spoilage. In this study, we developed an oriented nanodisc (ND)-functionalized bioelectronic nose (ONBN), based on carbon nanotube transistors and nanodiscs embedded with an olfactory receptor produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli) for detection of CV. To fabricate ONBN devices, a trace-amine-associated receptor 13c (TAAR13c) binding to CV was produced in E. coli, purified, reconstituted into NDs, and assembled, in the desired orientation, onto a carbon- nanotube-based field-effect transistor with floating electrodes. The ONBN showed high performance in terms of sensitivity and selectivity. Moreover, the ONBN was used to measure CV in diverse real-food samples for the determination of food freshness. These results indicate ONBN devices can be utilized to evaluate the quality of food samples quantitatively, which should enable versatile practical applications such as food safety and preservative development. Moreover, the ONBN could provide a useful tool for detection of corpses, which could be practically used in disaster responses.}

      \field{abstract}{A multiplexed bioelectronic sensor was developed for the purpose of rapid, on-site, and simultaneous detection of various target molecules. Olfactory and taste receptors were produced in Escherichia coli, and the reconstituted receptors were immobilized onto a multi-channel type carbon nanotube field-effect transistor. This device mimicked the human olfactory/taste system and simultaneously measured the conductance changes with high sensitivity and selectivity following treatment with various odor and taste molecules commonly known to be indicators of food contamination. Various pattern recognition of odorants and tastants was available with a customized platform for the simultaneous measurement of electrical signals. The simple portable bioelectronic device was suitable for efficient monitoring of food freshness and is expected to be used as a rapid on-site sensing platform with various applications.}

      \field{abstract}{Detector dogs could be trained to find invasive insect pests at borders before they establish in new areas. However, without access to the live insects themselves, odor training aids are needed to condition dogs to their scent. This proof-of-concept study assessed 2 potential training aids for insect detection: a scent extract and dead specimens of the target species. Using Musgraveia sulciventris (Hemiptera: Tessaratomidae) as an experimental model, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses were carried out to compare the chemical headspaces that make up the odors of live specimens and these 2 training aids. This was then followed by canine scent-detection testing to investigate biosecurity detector dogs' (n = 4) responses to training in an ecologically valid context. Both the scent extract and the dead specimens shared the majority of their volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with live insects. Of the dogs trained with scent extract (n = 2), both were able to detect the live insects accurately, and of those trained with dead specimens (n = 2), one detected the live insects accurately. These findings lend support for these training aids as odor-proxies for live insects - particularly scent extract, which is a relatively novel product with the potential for broad application to facilitate and improve insect-detection training.}

      \field{abstract}{The olfactory system has the ability to discriminate and identify thousands of odorant compounds at very low concentrations. Recently, many researchers have been trying to develop artificial sensing devices that are based on the olfactory system. A bioelectronic nose, which uses olfactory receptors (ORs) as sensing elements, would benefit naturally optimized molecular recognition. Accordingly, ORs can be effectively used as a biological element in bioelectronic noses. Bioelectronic nose can be classified into cell-based and protein-based biosensors. The cell-based biosensor uses living cells that express olfactory receptors as the biological sensing elements and the protein-based biosensor uses the olfactory receptor protein. The binding of odorant molecules to the ORs can be measured using various methods such as piezoelectric, optic, and electric devices. Thus, bioelectronic nose can be developed by combining the biological sensing elements with these non-biological devices. The application of bioelectronic nose in a wide range of different scientific and medical fields is essentially dependent on the development of highly sensitive and selective biosensors. These sensor systems for the rapid detection of specific odorants are crucial for environmental monitoring, anti-bioterrorism, disease diagnostics, and food safety. In this article, we reviewed recent advances in the development of bioelectronic nose. © KSBB.}

      \field{abstract}{Various nanobiosensors composed of biomaterials and nanomaterials have been developed, due to their demonstrated advantage of showing high performance. Among various biomaterials for biological recognition elements of the nanobiosensor, sensory receptors, such as olfactory and taste receptors, are promising biomaterials for developing nanobiosensors, because of their high selectivity to target molecules. Field-effect transistors (FET) with nanomaterials such as carbon nanotube (CNT), graphene, and conducting polymer nanotube (CPNT), can be combined with the biomaterials to enhance the sensitivity of nanobiosensors. Recently, many efforts have been made to develop nanobiosensors using biomaterials, such as olfactory receptors and taste receptors for detecting various smells and tastes. This review focuses on the biomaterials and nanomaterials used in nanobiosensor systems and studies of various types of nanobiosensor platforms that utilize olfactory receptors and taste receptors which could be applied to a wide range of industrial fields, including the food and beverage industry, environmental monitoring, the biomedical field, and anti-terrorism.}

      \field{abstract}{The detection of volatile organic compound (VOC) mixtures is crucial in the medical and security fields. Receptor-based odorant biosensors sensitively and selectively detect odorant molecules in a solution; however, odorant molecules generally exist as VOCs in the air and exhibit poor water solubility. Therefore, techniques that enable the dissolution of poorly water-soluble VOCs using portable systems are essential for practical biosensors’ applications. We previously proposed a VOC dissolution method based on water atomization to increase the surface area via the generation of fine bubbles, as a proof-of-concept; however, the system was lab-based (non-mobile) and the dissolution was limited to one VOC. In this study, we established a highly effective VOC dissolution method based on mist atomization that can be used in the field. This new method demonstrated a rapid dissolution potential of a sparsely-soluble VOC mixture with various functional groups in distilled water (DW) within 1 min, without the use of any organic solvents. Calcium imaging revealed that odorant receptor 13a-expressing Sf21 cells (Or13a cells) responded to 1-octen-3-ol in the mixture. Further, we successfully developed a field-deployable prototype vacuum and dissolution system with a simple configuration that efficiently captured and rapidly dissolved airborne 1-octen-3-ol in DW. This study proposes a field-deployable system that is appropriate for solubilizing various airborne odorant molecules and therefore is a practical strategy to use in the context of odorant biosensors.}

      \field{abstract}{Olfactory receptors (ORs) are the largest family of the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are significantly involved in many human diseases and 40\% of all drug targets. A platform containing stable and high-quality OR would be a powerful tool for the development of a practical biosensor that can be applied to various applications, such as the early diagnosis of diseases, assessment of food quality, and drug and fragrance development. Significant efforts have been made to develop the biosensor using GPCRs; nevertheless, they remain a challenge. This chapter describes an attractive methodology for the development of a stable bioelectronic nose using OR-embedded nanodiscs. The ORs were produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli), purified with column chromatography, reconstituted into nanodiscs and applied to a carbon nanotube-field effect transistor (CNT-FET) with floating electrodes. The nanodisc-based bioelectronic nose exhibits high-performance in terms of sensitivity, selectivity and stability. This strategy can be used as a practical method for the receptor-based sensing approach, which represents significant progress in nano-bio technology toward a practical biosensor.}

      \field{abstract}{We have undertaken a functional analysis of the odorant receptor repertoire in the Drosophila antenna. Each receptor was expressed in a mutant olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) used as a "decoder," and the odor response spectrum conferred by the receptor was determined in vivo by electrophysiological recordings. The spectra of these receptors were then matched to those of defined ORNs to establish a receptor-to-neuron map. In addition to the odor response spectrum, the receptors dictate the signaling mode, i.e., excitation or inhibition, and the response dynamics of the neuron. An individual receptor can mediate both excitatory and inhibitory responses to different odorants in the same cell, suggesting a model of odorant receptor transduction. Receptors vary widely in their breadth of tuning, and odorants vary widely in the number of receptors they activate. Together, these properties provide a molecular basis for odor coding by the receptor repertoire of an olfactory organ.}

      \field{abstract}{Olfaction in Drosophila is mediated by a large family of membrane-bound odorant receptor proteins (Ors). In heterologous cells, we investigated whether the structural features and signalling mechanisms of ligand-binding Drosophila Ors are consistent with them being G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The detailed membrane topology of Or22a was determined by inserting epitope tags into the termini and predicted loop regions. Immunocytochemistry experiments in Drosophila S2 cells imply that Or22a has seven transmembrane domains but that its membrane topology is opposite to that of GPCRs, with a cytoplasmic N-terminus and extracellular C-terminus. To investigate Or signalling mechanisms, we expressed Or43b in Sf9 and HEK293 cells, and show that inhibitors of heterotrimeric G proteins (GDP-β-S), adenylate cyclase (SQ22536), guanylyl cyclase (ODQ), cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (IBMX) and phospholipase C (U73122) have negligible impact on Or43b responses. Whole cell patching of Or43b/Or83b-transfected HEK293 cells revealed the opening of plasma membrane cation channels on addition of ligand. The response was blocked by lanthanum and by 2-APB, but not by Ruthenium red or SKF96365. Based on these data, we conclude that Drosophila Ors comprise a novel family of seven transmembrane receptors that in HEK293 cells signal by opening cation channels, through a mechanism that is largely independent of G proteins. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

      \field{abstract}{From worm to man, many odorant signals are perceived by the binding of volatile ligands to odorant receptors that belong to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. They couple to heterotrimeric G-proteins, most of which induce cAMP production. This second messenger then activates cyclic-nucleotide-gated ion channels to depolarize the olfactory receptor neuron, thus providing a signal for further neuronal processing. Recent findings, however, have challenged this concept of odorant signal transduction in insects, because their odorant receptors, which lack any sequence similarity to other GPCRs, are composed of conventional odorant receptors (for example, Or22a), dimerized with a ubiquitously expressed chaperone protein, such as Or83b in Drosophila. Or83b has a structure akin to GPCRs, but has an inverted orientation in the plasma membrane. However, G proteins are expressed in insect olfactory receptor neurons, and olfactory perception is modified by mutations affecting the cAMP transduction pathway. Here we show that application of odorants to mammalian cells co-expressing Or22a and Or83b results in non-selective cation currents activated by means of an ionotropic and a metabotropic pathway, and a subsequent increase in the intracellular Ca 2+ concentration. Expression of Or83b alone leads to functional ion channels not directly responding to odorants, but being directly activated by intracellular cAMP or cGMP. Insect odorant receptors thus form ligand-gated channels as well as complexes of odorant-sensing units and cyclic-nucleotide- activated non-selective cation channels. Thereby, they provide rapid and transient as well as sensitive and prolonged odorant signalling. ©2008 Nature Publishing Group.}

      \field{abstract}{Odors elicit complex patterns of activated olfactory sensory neurons. Knowing the complete olfactome, i.e. the responses in all sensory neurons for all relevant odorants, is desirable to understand olfactory coding. The DoOR project combines all available Drosophila odorant response data into a single consensus response matrix. Since its first release many studies were published: receptors were deorphanized and several response profiles were expanded. In this study, we add unpublished data to the odor-response profiles for four odorant receptors (Or10a, Or42b, Or47b, Or56a). We deorphanize Or69a, showing a broad response spectrum with the best ligands including 3-hydroxyhexanoate, alpha-terpineol, 3-octanol and linalool. We include all of these datasets into DoOR, provide a comprehensive update of both code and data, and new tools for data analyses and visualizations. The DoOR project has a web interface for quick queries (http://neuro.uni.kn/DoOR), and a downloadable, open source toolbox written in R, including all processed and original datasets. DoOR now gives reliable odorant-responses for nearly all Drosophila olfactory responding units, listing 693 odorants, for a total of 7381 data points.}

      \field{abstract}{The olfactory receptor neurons of insects and vertebrates are gated by odorant receptor (OR) proteins of which several members have been shown to exhibit remarkable sensitivity and selectivity towards volatile organic compounds of significant importance in the fields of medicine, agriculture and public health. Insect ORs offer intrinsic amplification where a single binding event is transduced into a measurable ionic current. Consequently, insect ORs have great potential as biorecognition elements in many sensor configurations. However, integrating these sensing components onto electronic transducers for the development of biosensors has been marginal due to several drawbacks, including their lipophilic nature, signal transduction mechanism and the limited number of known cognate receptor-ligand pairs. We review the current state of research in this emerging field and highlight the use of a group of indole-sensitive ORs (indolORs) from unexpected sources for the development of biosensors.}

      \field{abstract}{Insect odorant receptors have been reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs and tethered to carbon nanotube field-effect transistors to function as a biosensor. Here, four different insect odorant receptors (ORs) from Drosophila melanogaster (DmelOR10a, DmelOR22a, DmelOR35a, and DmelOR71a) were expressed in Sf9 cells, purified, and reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs. We have demonstrated that each of these ORs produce a selective and highly sensitive electrical response to their respective positive ligands, methyl salicylate, methyl hexanoate, trans-2-hexen-1-al, and 4-ethylguaiacol, with limits of detection in the low femtomolar range. No detection was observed for each OR against control ligands, and empty nanodiscs showed no specific sensor signal for any of the odorant molecules. Our results are the first evidence that insect ORs can be integrated into lipid nanodiscs and used as primary sensing elements for bioelectronic nose technologies.}

The biosensors were fabricated by immobilizing the OR nanodiscs and OR ± Orco liposomes onto GFET devices. Two ORs from Drosophila melanogaster (DmelOR10a and DmelOR22a) were used in this study. We demonstrated that both DmelOR10a and DmelOR22a in nanodiscs and OR ± Orco liposomes showed a selective electrical response to their respective positive ligands, methyl salicylate and methyl hexanoate. The OR nanodisc sensors produced the strongest sensing signal with a limit of detection of 1 fm. We also found that the upper detection limit was increased, and the sensitivity of the Orco coexpressed liposome sensors was enhanced by approximately an order of magnitude when compared to the OR liposome sensors.}

      \field{abstract}{This paper reports a volatile organic compound (VOC) sensor based on olfactory receptors that were reconstituted into a lipid bilayer and used in a specifically designed gas flow system for rapid parts per billion (ppb)-level detection. This VOC sensor achieves both rapid detection and high detection probability because of its gas flow system and array design. Specifically, the gas flow system includes microchannels and hydrophobic microslits, which facilitate both the introduction of gas into the droplet and droplet mixing. We installed this system into a parallel lipid bilayer device and subsequently demonstrated parts per billion-level (0.5 ppb) detection of 1-octen-3-ol in human breath. Therefore, this system extends the various applications of biological odorant sensing, including breath diagnosis systems and environmental monitoring.}

      \field{abstract}{Herein, we present that insect odorant receptors reconstituted into the lipid bilayers of liposomes can be successfully immobilized onto a gold surface and selectively and sensitively detect odorant molecules. The odorant receptors (OrXs) Or10a, Or22a, and Or71a from the common fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, were recombinantly expressed, purified and integrated into nano-liposomes (100–200 nm). These liposomes were covalently attached to the self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of a 6-mercaptohexanoic acid (MHA)-modified gold surface. X-ray Photo Electron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation (QCM-D) measurements confirmed the successful modification of the gold surface and immobilization of liposomes. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) revealed that the liposomes were covalently attached to the surface without any disruption of vesicles. The liposomes tethered to the gold sensor surface were then treated with a range of known ligands of various concentrations. We demonstrated by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) that an OrX/liposome EIS sensor can sensitively and selectively detect its known ligand to femtomolar concentrations by detecting a change in electrical signal upon binding. Our study is the first step towards using purified insect odorant receptors alone in biosensors to enable the development of novel ultrasensitive volatile sensors for medical diagnostic, air quality, food safety and border security applications.}

      \field{abstract}{An electrochemical sensing methodology using an insect odorant receptor (iOR) as the biological recognition element for detection of odorant compounds is presented. Or22a from the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (DmOr22a) was used as a model receptor for the study. DmOr22a in phospholipid nanodisc preparations was shown to be functionally active toward its known ligand (ethyl hexanoate), as measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). iOR nanodiscs covalently immobilized on a gold substrate were further characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) and neutron reflectometry in order to study surface modification and understand the underlying mechanisms associated with ligand binding. The EIS sensor exhibited high sensitivity and specificity towards ethyl hexanoate with a detection limit of 5.5 fM. Neutron reflectometry studies provided evidence to support conformational changes in the receptor upon ligand binding. The EIS based detection strategy provides a facile, sensitive and fast method for detecting odorant compounds and paves the way for further development of odorant biosensors.}

      \field{abstract}{Biohybrid odorant sensors that directly integrate a biological olfactory system have been increasingly studied and are suggested to be the next generation of ultrasensitive sensors by taking advantage of the sensitivity and selectivity of living organisms. In this review, we provide a detailed description of the recent developments of biohybrid odorant sensors, especially considering the requisites for their perspective of on-site applications. We introduce the methodologies to effectively capture the biological signals from olfactory systems by readout devices, and describe the essential properties regarding the gaseous detection, stability, quality control, and portability. Moreover, we address the recent progress on multiple odorant recognition using multiple sensors as well as the current screening approaches for pairs of orphan receptors and ligands necessary for the extension of the currently available range of biohybrid sensors. Finally, we discuss our perspectives for the future for the development of practical odorant sensors.}

      \field{abstract}{The field of flexible electronics has rapidly expanded over the last decades, pioneering novel applications, such as wearable and textile integrated devices, seamless and embedded patch-like systems, soft electronic skins, as well as imperceptible and transient implants. The possibility to revolutionize our daily life with such disruptive appliances has fueled the quest for electronic devices which yield good electrical and mechanical performance and are at the same time light-weight, transparent, conformable, stretchable, and even biodegradable. Flexible metal oxide semiconductor thin-film transistors (TFTs) can fulfill all these requirements and are therefore considered the most promising technology for tomorrow's electronics. This review reflects the establishment of flexible metal oxide semiconductor TFTs, from the development of single devices, large-area circuits, up to entirely integrated systems. First, an introduction on metal oxide semiconductor TFTs is given, where the history of the field is revisited, the TFT configurations and operating principles are presented, and the main issues and technological challenges faced in the area are analyzed. Then, the recent advances achieved for flexible n-type metal oxide semiconductor TFTs manufactured by physical vapor deposition methods and solution-processing techniques are summarized. In particular, the ability of flexible metal oxide semiconductor TFTs to combine low temperature fabrication, high carrier mobility, large frequency operation, extreme mechanical bendability, together with transparency, conformability, stretchability, and water dissolubility is shown. Afterward, a detailed analysis of the most promising metal oxide semiconducting materials developed to realize the state-of-the-art flexible p-type TFTs is given. Next, the recent progresses obtained for flexible metal oxide semiconductor-based electronic circuits, realized with both unipolar and complementary technology, are reported. In particular, the realization of large-area digital circuitry like flexible near field communication tags and analog integrated circuits such as bendable operational amplifiers is presented. The last topic of this review is devoted for emerging flexible electronic systems, from foldable displays, power transmission elements to integrated systems for large-area sensing and data storage and transmission. Finally, the conclusions are drawn and an outlook over the field with a prediction for the future is provided.}

      \field{abstract}{Graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have gained major research interests as signal transducing elements in electrical biosensors for applications in biosensing of a wide range of analytes. This is mostly due to the unique physical, chemical, and electrical properties of the carbon nanomaterials. This review discusses the integration and applications of these carbon allotropes into field-effect transistor-type (FET-type) nanobiosensors. We first discuss the various properties of CNTs and graphene that make them useful and attractive for FET-type sensing, followed by methods for synthesis of CNTs and graphene nanomaterials. Additionally, the underlying sensing mechanisms of CNT- and graphene-based FET-type biosensors and the methods for fabrication of these devices are discussed. Finally, recent reports on CNT- and graphene-based FET biosensors that employed a variety of novel device configurations, fabrication techniques, and assay strategies to achieve sensitive detection of small molecules, metal ions, proteins, and nucleic acids are examined.}

      \field{abstract}{Chemical and biological sensors have attracted great interest due to their importance in applications of healthcare, food quality monitoring, environmental monitoring, etc. Carbon nanotube (CNT)-based field-effect transistors (FETs) are novel sensing device configurations and are very promising for their potential to drive many technological advancements in this field due to the extraordinary electrical properties of CNTs. This review focuses on the implementation of CNT-based FETs (CNTFETs) in chemical and biological sensors. It begins with the introduction of properties, and surface functionalization of CNTs for sensing. Then, configurations and sensing mechanisms for CNT FETs are introduced. Next, recent progresses of CNTFET-based chemical sensors, and biological sensors are summarized. Finally, we end the review with an overview about the current application status and the remaining challenges for the CNTFET-based chemical and biological sensors.}

      \field{abstract}{A thin-film transistor, TFT, fabricated by evaporation of all components on to an insulating substrate has been developed. Operation is based upon the control of injected majority carriers in a wide-band-gap semiconductor by means of an insulated control gate. Experimental units using microcrystalline layers of cadmium sulfide have yielded voltage amplification factors greater than 100, transconductances greater than 10,000 μmho, input impedances greater than 106 Ω shunted by 50 pf and gain-bandwidth products greater than 10 Mc. Switching speeds of less than 0.1 μxsec have been observed. Simple evaporated thin-film circuits incorporating the TFT have been built. Direct coupling between stages is permitted since the insulated gate electrode can be biased positively as well as negatively without drawing appreciable gate current. Modified forms of the TFT have been built for use as a flip-flop, an AND gate and a NOR gate in computer applications. Copyright ©1962 by The Institute of Radio Engineers, Inc.}

      \field{abstract}{Ultrathin films of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) represent an attractive, emerging class of material, with properties that can approach the exceptional electrical, mechanical, and optical characteristics of individual SWNTs, in a format that, unlike isolated tubes, is readily suitable for scalable integration into devices. These features suggest the potential for realistic applications as conducting or semiconducting layers in diverse types of electronic, optoelectronic and sensor systems. This article reviews recent advances in assembly techniques for forming such films, modeling and experimental work that reveals their collective properties, and engineering aspects of implementation in sensors and in electronic devices and circuits with various levels of complexity. A concluding discussion provides some perspectives on possibilities for future work in fundamental and applied aspects. © 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA.}

      \field{abstract}{The development of biosensors based on field-effect transistors (FETs) using atomically thick carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as a channel material has the potential to revolutionize the related field due to their small size, high sensitivity, label-free detection, and real-time monitoring capabilities. Despite extensive research efforts to improve the sensitivity, selectivity, and practicality of CNT FET-based biosensors, their commercialization has not yet been achieved due to the non-uniform and unstable device performance, difficulties in their fabrication, the immaturity of sensor packaging processes, and a lack of reliable modification methods. This review article focuses on the practical applications of CNT-based FET biosensors for the detection of ultra-low concentrations of biologically relevant molecules. We discuss the various factors that affect the sensors’ performance in terms of materials, device architecture, and sensor packaging, highlighting the need for a robust commercial process that prioritizes product performance. Additionally, we review recent advances in the application of CNT FET biosensors for the ultra-sensitive detection of various biomarkers. Finally, we examine the key obstacles that currently hinder the large-scale deployment of these biosensors, aiming to identify the challenges that must be addressed for the future industrialization of CNT FET sensors.}

      \field{abstract}{We present an experimental and theoretical comparison of the weak and strong gate-coupling regimes that arise for carbon nanotube (CNT) and graphene field-effect transistors (FETs) in back-gated and liquid-gated configuration, respectively. We find that whereas the back-gate efficiency is suppressed for a liquid-gated CNT FET, the back gate is still effective in case of a liquid-gated graphene FET. We calculate the gateinduced Fermi-level shifts and induced charge densities. In both strong and weak coupling regimes, nonlinearities occur in the gate dependence of these parameters, which can significantly influence the electronic transport. © 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

      \field{abstract}{This work is focused on the fabrication and analysis of graphene-based, solution-gated field effect transistor arrays (GFETs) on a large scale for bioelectronic measurements. The GFETs fabricated on different substrates, with a variety of gate geometries (width/length) of the graphene channel, reveal a linear relation between the transconductance and the width/length ratio. The area normalised electrolyte-gated transconductance is in the range of 1–2 mS·V−1·□ and does not strongly depend on the substrate. Influence of the ionic strength on the transistor performance is also investigated. Double contacts are found to decrease the effective resistance and the transfer length, but do not improve the transconductance. An electrochemical annealing/cleaning effect is investigated and proposed to originate from the out-of-plane gate leakage current. The devices are used as a proof-of-concept for bioelectronic sensors, recording external potentials from both: ex vivo heart tissue and in vitro cardiomyocyte-like HL-1 cells. The recordings show distinguishable action potentials with a signal to noise ratio over 14 from ex vivo tissue and over 6 from the cardiac-like cell line in vitro. Furthermore, in vitro neuronal signals are recorded by the graphene transistors with distinguishable bursting for the first time.}

      \field{abstract}{Field-effect transistors based on single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and graphene can function as highly sensitive nanoscale (bio)sensors in solution. Here, we compare experimentally how SWNT and graphene transistors respond to changes in the composition of the aqueous electrolyte in which they are immersed. We show that the conductance of SWNTs and graphene is strongly affected by changes in the ionic strength, the pH, and the type of ions present, in a manner that can be qualitatively different for graphene and SWNT devices. We show that this sensitivity to electrolyte composition results from a combination of different mechanisms including electrostatic gating, Schottky-barrier modifications, and changes in gate capacitance. Interestingly, we find strong evidence that the sensor response to changes in electrolyte composition is affected by a high density of ionizable groups on both the underlying substrate and the carbon surfaces. We present a model based on the (regulated) surface charge associated with these ionizable groups that explains the majority of our data. Our findings have significant implications for interpreting and optimizing sensing experiments with nanocarbon transistors. This is particularly true for complex biological samples such as cell extracts, growth media, or bodily fluids, for which the complete composition of the solution needs to be considered. © 2010 American Chemical Society.}

      \field{abstract}{Supercapacitor technology encompasses a wide field of research that has already marked its foot in commercialization, just after some initial years of concept development. A couple of past decades have witnessed enormous growth in gaining insights into the pseudocapacitive phenomenon and developing novel structures exhibiting this property. Carbon nanostructures, especially single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), are considered potentially revolutionary materials, showing double-layer capacitance, which can be exploited for energy storage applications. This review article aims to examine the fundamental phenomenon by which SWCNTs could be utilized as pseudocapacitive electrodes by incorporating various conducting materials in their matrix. This study aims to provide a detailed overview of the latest technological advances in materials science, design, fabrication, and achievements of SWCNT hybrids as primary electrodes in charge storage devices. The discussion encompasses binary composites, including SWCNT/metal and SWCNT/polymer composites, as well as ternary hybrids, giving an overall comprehensive understanding of the latest advancements in this field along with the pressing challenges.}

      \field{abstract}{Since the electrical characteristics of graphene field-effect transistors (FETs) are very sensitive for their environmental condition, the graphene FETs have high potential for chemical and biological sensors. In this chapter, the electrical detection of biomolecules and ions by graphene FETs was described. The grapheme FETs can be operated in the buffer solution by top-gate operation from a reference electrode without any passivation film. And their transconductance was more than 200 times larger than that of the conventional back-gate operation in vacuum. The drain current increased with increasing the solution pH. And the grapheme FETs detected the charges in proteins. To detect the specific protein, aptamers were functionalized on the graphene surface. As results, aptamer-modified grapheme FETs detected the target molecule, and their sensitivity was comparable to other aptamer-based biosensors.}

      \field{abstract}{Nanomaterial-based FET sensors represent an attractive platform for ultrasensitive, real-time, and label-free detection of chemical and biological species. Nevertheless, because their response is screened by mobile ions, it remains a challenge to use them to sense in physiological ionic strength solutions. In this work, it is demonstrated, both experimentally and theoretically, that polyelectrolyte multilayers are capable of increasing the sensing range of graphene-based FETs. Potential shifts at graphene surfaces and film thickness are recorded upon the construction of PDADMAC/PSS polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) films. By correlation of the potential shift with the film thickness, the electrostatic screening length and the concentration of mobile ion inside the films have been deduced. Across the polymer interface the Debye length is increased more than 1 order of magnitude. The fundamentals of this strategy are described by a conceptually simple thermodynamic model, which accounts for the entropy loss of ion confinement and incorporates the effect of ions finite volume. Interestingly, the electrostatic screening inside the film strongly depends on the polymer density and the ionic strength of the solution. Of particular interest in physiological condition sensing, the PEM interfaces can extend the Debye length from 0.8 to 10 nm.}

      \field{abstract}{Nanomaterial-based field-effect transistor (FET) sensors are capable of label-free real-time chemical and biological detection with high sensitivity and spatial resolution, although direct measurements in high-ionic-strength physiological solutions remain challenging due to the Debye screening effect. Recently, we demonstrated a general strategy to overcome this challenge by incorporating a biomolecule-permeable polymer layer on the surface of silicon nanowire FET sensors. The permeable polymer layer can increase the effective screening length immediately adjacent to the device surface and thereby enable real-time detection of biomolecules in high-ionic-strength solutions. Here, we describe studies demonstrating both the generality of this concept and application to specific protein detection using graphene FET sensors. Concentration-dependent measurements made with polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified graphene devices exhibited real-time reversible detection of prostate specific antigen (PSA) from 1 to 1,000 nM in 100 mM phosphate buffer. In addition, comodification of graphene devices with PEG and DNA aptamers yielded specific irreversible binding and detection of PSA in pH 7.4 1x PBS solutions, whereas control experiments with proteins that do not bind to the aptamer showed smaller reversible signals. In addition, the active aptamer receptor of the modified graphene devices could be regenerated to yield multiuse selective PSA sensing under physiological conditions. The current work presents an important concept toward the application of nanomaterial-based FET sensors for biochemical sensing in physiological environments and thus could lead to powerful tools for basic research and healthcare.}

      \field{abstract}{Nanomaterial-based field-effect transistors (FETs) have been proposed for real-time, label-free detection of various biological species. However, two major challenges have limited their use in physiological samples: screening of the analyte charge by electrolyte ions (Debye screening) and non-specific adsorption. Here, these challenges are overcome by combining highly stable FETs based on single-walled semiconducting carbon nanotube (SWCNTs) networks with a novel surface functionalization comprising: 1) short nanobody (VHH) receptors, and 2) a polyethylene glycol (PEG) layer. Nanobodies are stable, easy-to-produce biological receptors that are very small (∼2–4 nm), thus enabling analyte binding closer to the sensor surface. Despite their unique properties, nanobodies have not been used yet as receptors in FET based biosensors. The addition of PEG strongly enhances the signal in high ionic strength environment. Using green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a model antigen, high selectivity and sub-picomolar detection limit with a dynamic range exceeding 5 orders of magnitude is demonstrated in physiological solutions. In addition, long-term stability measurements reveal a low drift of SWCNTs of 0.05 mV/h. The presented immunoassay is fast, label-free, does not require any sample pretreatment or washing steps.}

      \field{abstract}{Electronic biosensors are a natural fit for field-deployable diagnostic devices because they can be miniaturized, mass produced, and integrated with circuitry. Unfortunately, progress in the development of such platforms has been hindered by the fact that mobile ions present in biological samples screen charges from the target molecule, greatly reducing sensor sensitivity. Under physiological conditions, the thickness of the resulting electric double layer is less than 1 nm, and it has generally been assumed that electronic detection beyond this distance is virtually impossible. However, a few recently described sensor design strategies seem to defy this conventional wisdom, exploiting the physics of electrical double layers in ways that traditional models do not capture. In the first strategy, charge screening is decreased by constraining the space in which double layers can form. The second strategy uses external stimuli to prevent double layers from reaching equilibrium, thereby effectively reducing charge screening. In this Perspective, we describe these relatively new concepts and offer theoretical insights into mechanisms that may enable electronic biosensing beyond the Debye length. If these concepts can be further developed and translated into practical electronic biosensors, we foresee exciting opportunities for the next generation of diagnostic technologies.}

      \field{abstract}{Interest in point-of-care diagnostics has led to increasing demand for the development of nanomaterial-based electronic biosensors such as biosensor field-effect transistors (BioFETs) due to their inherent simplicity, sensitivity, and scalability. The utility of BioFETs, which use electrical transduction to detect biological signals, is directly dependent upon their electrical stability in detection-relevant environments. However, BioFET device structures vary substantially, especially in electrode passivation modalities. Improper passivation of electronic components in ionic solutions can lead to excessive leakage currents and signal drift, thus presenting a hinderance to signal detectability. Here, we harness the sensitivity of nanomaterials to study the effects of various passivation strategies on the performance and stability of a biosensing platform based on aerosol-jet-printed carbon nanotube thin-film transistors. Specifically, nonpassivated devices were compared to devices passivated with photoresist (SU-8), dielectric (HfO2), or photoresist + dielectric (SU-8 followed by HfO2) and were evaluated primarily by initial performance metrics, large-scale device yield, and stability throughout long-duration cycling in phosphate buffered saline. We find that all three passivation conditions result in improved device performance compared to nonpassivated devices, with the photoresist + dielectric strategy providing the lowest average leakage current in solution (~ 2 nA). Notably, the photoresist + dielectric strategy also results in the greatest yield of BioFET devices meeting our selected performance criteria on a wafer scale (~ 90\%), the highest long-term stability in solution (>0.01\% change in on-current), and the best average on/off-current ratio (~ 104), hysteresis (~ 32 mV), and subthreshold swing (~ 192 mV/decade). This passivation schema has the potential to pave the path toward a truly high-yield, stable, and robust electrical biosensing platform.}

      \field{abstract}{Carbon nanotubes (CNT) and semiconducting nanowires have demonstrated outstanding potential for a wide range of applications, including fi eld effect transistors (FETs) and high-frequency electronics, chemical sensors, nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS), thin fi lm transistors, and display electronics. Their small size, high mobility (near- ballistic electron transport), high intrinsic cut-off frequency, mechanical and thermal stability, high-current-carrying density, and the capability of having both semiconducting and metallic tubes make carbon-based devices promising candidates to replace silicon-based devices in some applications [1]. One dimensional nanostructures, such as semiconducting nanowires and CNTs, have been heavily investigated as digital devices, but, so far, the study of such structures for radio-frequency (RF) applications is in its infancy. Although the fi eld is still under development, we are beginning to understand some of the possible advantages of such systems over traditional, two-dimensional based technologies. Since 2004, it has been speculated that CNT devices have, potentially, terahertz cutoff frequencies [2]. However, only recently have the device cutoff frequencies crossed into the gigahertz range, as reviewed in [1]. © 2006 IEEE.}

      \field{abstract}{Carbon nanotube network thin film transistors with channel lengths of 10-40 μm are fabricated from a nanotube buckypaper with 99\% semiconducting carbon nanotubes by surfactant free solution routes. The carbon nanotubes are suspended in 1,2-dichlorobenzene by ultrasonication at concentrations of 7.9 μg/ml, 3.4 μg/ml and 2.6 μg/ml, resulting in carbon nanotube field effect transistors with tube densities ranging from 5 tube/μm2 up to 32 tube/μm2. The device percolation threshold is 11 tube/μm2 with optimum device performances of on/off current ratio 7200, mobility 0.55 cm2/V·s and Vth = +1 V. Devices with tube density above the percolation threshold are typically metallic-like. By encapsulating with poly-4-vinylphenol cross-linked with poly-(melamine-co-formaldehyde), the hysteresis becomes independent of channel length and the device performance approaches the best devices at the percolation threshold.}

      \field{abstract}{Thousands of reports have demonstrated the exceptional performance of sensors based on carbon nanotube (CNT) transistors, with promises of transformative impact. Yet, the effect of long-term bias stress on individual CNTs, critical for most sensing applications, has remained uncertain. Here, we report bias ranges under which CNT transistors can operate continuously for months or more without degradation. Using a custom characterization system, the impacts of defect formation and charge traps on the stability of CNT-based sensors under extended bias are determined. In addition to breakdown, which is well-known, we identify three additional operational modes: full stability, slow decay, and fast decay. We identify a current drift behavior that reduces dynamic range by over four orders of magnitude but is avoidable with appropriate sensing modalities. Identification of these stable operation modes and limits for nanotube-based sensors addresses concerns surrounding their development for a myriad of sensing applications.}

      \field{abstract}{Despite extensive experimental and theoretical studies, the atomistic mechanisms responsible for dielectric breakdown (BD) in amorphous (a)-SiO2 are still poorly understood. A number of qualitative physical models and mathematical formulations have been proposed over the years to explain experimentally observable statistical trends. However, these models do not provide clear insight into the physical origins of the BD process. Here, we investigate the physical mechanisms responsible for dielectric breakdown in a-SiO2 using a multi-scale approach where the energetic parameters derived from a microscopic mechanism are used to predict the macroscopic degradation parameters of BD, i.e., time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) statistics, and its voltage dependence. Using this modeling framework, we demonstrate that trapping of two electrons at intrinsic structural precursors in a-SiO2 is responsible for a significant reduction of the activation energy for Si-O bond breaking. This results in a lower barrier for the formation of O vacancies and allows us to explain quantitatively the TDDB data reported in the literature for relatively thin (3-9 nm) a-SiO2 oxide films.}

      \field{abstract}{Graphene field effect transistors commonly comprise graphene flakes lying on SiO2 surfaces. The gate-voltage dependent conductance shows hysteresis depending on the gate sweeping rate/range. It is shown here that the transistors exhibit two different kinds of hysteresis in their electrical characteristics. Charge transfer causes a positive shift in the gate voltage of the minimum conductance, while capacitive gating can cause the negative shift of conductance with respect to gate voltage. The positive hysteretic phenomena decay with an increase of the number of layers in graphene flakes. Self-heating in a helium atmosphere significantly removes adsorbates and reduces positive hysteresis. We also observed negative hysteresis in graphene devices at low temperature. It is also found that an ice layer on/under graphene has a much stronger dipole moment than a water layer does. Mobile ions in the electrolyte gate and a polarity switch in the ferroelectric gate could also cause negative hysteresis in graphene transistors. These findings improved our understanding of the electrical response of graphene to its surroundings. The unique sensitivity to environment and related phenomena in graphene deserve further studies on nonvolatile memory, electrostatic detection, and chemically driven applications. © 2010 American Chemical Society.}

      \field{abstract}{Carbon nanotube field-effect transistors commonly comprise nanotubes lying on SiO 2 surfaces exposed to the ambient environment. It is shown here that the transistors exhibit hysteresis in their electrical characteristics because of charge trapping by water molecules around the nanotubes, including SiO 2 surface-bound water proximal to the nanotubes. Hysteresis persists for the transistors in vacuum since the SiO 2-bound water does not completely desorb in vacuum at room temperature, a known phenomenon in SiO 2 surface chemistry. Heating under dry conditions significantly removes water and reduces hysteresis in the transistors. Nearly hysteresis-free transistors are obtainable by passivating the devices with polymers that hydrogen bond with silanol groups on SiO 2 (e.g., with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)). However, nanotube humidity sensors could be explored with suitable water-sensitive coatings. The results may have implications to field-effect transistors made from other chemically derived materials. The interaction between single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and molecular species in the environment can significantly affect the electrical properties of nanotube devices. 1 This effect can be exploited for nanoscale chemical sensors, 2,3 but is not desired for nanotube-based field-effect transistors (FETs) 4-13 potentially applied to future electronics. Passivation of these transistors should be developed to impart stable electrical characteristics against environmental changes. Hysteresis due to various charge traps in a FET must be eliminated for most applications or must be controlled for specific memory devices. Recently, several groups reported SWNT FETs fabricated on SiO 2 /Si substrates (device structure similar to that in Figure 1a) exhibiting hysteresis in current versus gate-voltage (Si as back-gate) characteristics and attributed the hysteresis to charge traps in bulk SiO 2 , oxygen-related defect trap sites near nanotubes, or traps at the SiO 2 /Si interface. 11,12,14 No dependence of the hysteresis on chemical environments was observed (e.g., in ambient air versus in vacuum). Here, we show that the foremost significant cause of hysteresis in passivation-free nanotube FETs is the water molecule, especially SiO 2 surface-bound water that cannot be fully removed by pumping in vacuum. We also report that a simple polymer coating can be used as passivation to afford nearly hysteresis-free nanotube transistors. The nanotube FETs used in this work were obtained by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) synthesis 15 of individual semiconducting SWNTs to bridge preformed molyb-denum source (S) and drain (D) electrodes (Figure 1b) 16 or. † Authors with equal contributions.

      \field{abstract}{We discuss the origin of an additional dip other than the charge neutrality point observed in the transfer characteristics of graphene-based field-effect transistors with a Si/SiO2 substrate used as the back-gate. The double dip is proved to arise from charge transfer between the graphene and the metal electrodes, while charge storage at the graphene/SiO2 interface can make it more evident. Considering a different Fermi energy from the neutrality point along the channel and partial charge pinning at the contacts, we propose a model which explains all the features observed in the gate voltage loops. We finally show that the double dip enhanced hysteresis in the transfer characteristics can be exploited to realize graphene-based memory devices. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.}

      \field{abstract}{This paper deals with the effect of negative gate bias stress with different times on the Carbon Nanotube Field Effect Transistor (CNTFET) based gas sensors, obtained using Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (SWCNTs) mats as channel. The effects of Gate Bias Stress (GBS) on transistor performance are important; hence it is necessary to understand how our device behaves under bias stress. To perform this work, I-V characteristics, are taken by applying a constant gate voltage (Vgs) for an extended time. I-V characteristics after stress exhibited an identical shape to the one before stress with an important degradation of the current that flows through the transistors. A possible source of the Bias Stress Effect (BSE) is traps in the semiconductor itself which are spatially and energetically isolated due to the disorder of SWCNTs. This hypothesis will be confirmed by the saturation of the drain current shift ∆I after a prolonged period of time. All isolated trap states are saturated and only electrical traps still active and give us the original I-V characteristics.}

      \field{abstract}{The Dirac point(s) in graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) are of great importance for electronic application. However, the lack of the effective means to distinguish the electrical properties of graphene at the contact and channel regions limits a clear understanding of their contributions to the Dirac point(s). A method, which can characterize the electrical properties of graphene under metal contact and in the channel, is developed, respectively. It is found that the Fermi levels of graphene at the contact and channel regions are quite different in the GFETs. The difference in Fermi levels results in the penetration of the doping effect under the contact into the channel with a length as long as 1 µm. The difference also causes the double Dirac point feature in the long-channel GFET due to the combined graphene properties both in contact and channel. One of the two Dirac points diminished in short-channel GFET due to the penetration of doping effect under the contact. The study demonstrates that the electrical behavior of short-channel GFET is dominated by the contact region. This paces a way to deeply understand and further improve the performances of GFETs by controlling the Fermi levels in the whole devices.}

      \field{abstract}{Ambient adsorption is known to cause hysteretic behavior and irreproducible transport phenomena in carbon nanotubes and their corresponding field-effect transistors. The authors report that pulsed measurements, with a time constant below 500 μs, provide reproducible characteristics of carbon nanotube field-effect transistor with minimal hysteresis. Transient measurements of fabricated devices in air reveal multiple time constants whose origins are linked to adsorption processes and the local electric field environment of the carbon nanotube surface. Additional measurements in vacuum allow them to further elaborate on distinct effects on device transport characteristics due to adsorption. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.}

      \field{abstract}{Degradation of silicon dioxide films is shown to occur primarily near interfaces with contacting metals or semiconductors. This deterioration is shown to be accountable through two mechanisms triggered by electron heating in the oxide conduction band. These mechanisms are trap creation and band-gap ionization by carriers with energies exceeding 2 and 9 eV with respect to the bottom of the oxide conduction band, respectively. The relationship of band-gap ionization to defect production and subsequent degradation is emphasized. The dependence of the generated sites on electric field, oxide thickness, temperature, voltage polarity, and processing for each mechanism is discussed. A procedure for separating and studying these two generation modes is also discussed. A unified model from simple kinetic relationships is developed and compared to the experimental results. Destructive breakdown of the oxide is shown to be correlated with "effective" interface softening due to the total defect generation caused by both mechanisms.}

      \field{abstract}{The electrical noise characteristics of single-walled carbon nanotubes have been investigated. For all three cases of individual isolated nanotubes, thin films of interconnected nanotubes, and bulk nanotube mats, anomalously large bias-dependent 1/f noise is found. The noise magnitude greatly exceeds that commonly observed in metal films, carbon resistors, or even carbon fibers with comparable resistances. A single empirical expression describes the noise for all nanotube samples, suggesting a common noise-generating mechanism proportional only to the number of nanotubes in the conductor. We consider likely sources of the fluctuations, and consequences for electronic applications of nanotuhes if the excessive noise cannot be suppressed. © 2000 American Institute of Physics.}

      \field{abstract}{Graphene is a rapidly rising star on the horizon of materials science and condensed-matter physics. This strictly two-dimensional material exhibits exceptionally high crystal and electronic quality, and, despite its short history, has already revealed a cornucopia of new physics and potential applications, which are briefly discussed here. Whereas one can be certain of the realness of applications only when commercial products appear, graphene no longer requires any further proof of its importance in terms of fundamental physics. Owing to its unusual electronic spectrum, graphene has led to the emergence of a new paradigm of 'relativistic' condensed-matter physics, where quantum relativistic phenomena, some of which are unobservable in high-energy physics, can now be mimicked and tested in table-top experiments. More generally, graphene represents a conceptually new class of materials that are only one atom thick, and, on this basis, offers new inroads into low-dimensional physics that has never ceased to surprise and continues to provide a fertile ground for applications.}

      \field{abstract}{Owing in part to scaling challenges for metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) and complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) logic, the semiconductor industry is placing an increased emphasis on emerging materials and devices that may provide improved MOSFET performance beyond the 22 nm node, or provide novel functionality for, e.g. 'beyond CMOS' devices. Graphene, with its novel and electron-hole symmetric band structure and its high carrier mobilities and thermal velocities, is one such material that has garnered a great deal of interest for both purposes. Single and few layer carbon sheets have been fabricated by a variety of techniques including mechanical exfoliation and chemical vapour deposition, and field-effect transistors have been demonstrated with room-temperature mobilities as high as 10 000 cm2 V-1 s-1. But graphene is a gapless semiconductor and gate control of current is challenging, off-state leakage currents are high, and current does not readily saturate with drain voltage. However, various ways to overcome, adapt to, or even embrace this property are now being considered for device applications. In this work we explore through illustrative examples the potential of and challenges to graphene use for conventional and novel device applications. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.}

      \field{abstract}{Wrinkling is a ubiquitous phenomenon in two-dimensional membranes. In particular, in the large-scale growth of graphene on metallic substrates, high densities of wrinkles are commonly observed. Despite their prevalence and potential impact on large-scale graphene electronics, relatively little is known about their structural morphology and electronic properties. Surveying the graphene landscape using atomic force microscopy, we found that wrinkles reach a certain maximum height before folding over. Calculations of the energetics explain the morphological transition and indicate that the tall ripples are collapsed into narrow standing wrinkles by van der Waals forces, analogous to large-diameter nanotubes. Quantum transport calculations show that conductance through these "collapsedwrinkle" structures is limited mainly by a density-of-states bottleneck and by interlayer tunneling across the collapsed bilayer region. Also through systematic measurements across large numbers of devices with wide "foldedwrinkles", we find a distinct anisotropy in their electrical resistivity, consistent with our transport simulations. These results highlight the coupling between morphology and electronic properties, which has important practical implications for large-scale high-speed graphene electronics. © 2012 American Chemical Society.}

      \field{abstract}{Folds in graphene - grafolds are frequently present even after transferring graphene layers, which were fabricated by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), onto SiO2 substrates. As we are showing in the present Letter, grafolds have a crucial role in determining the morphology of pentacene layers on graphene, and should be as such considered in designing fabrication protocols of pentacene-graphene devices. Our atomic force microscopy investigation of the initial stages of growth of vacuum-evaporated pentacene on CVD graphene shows three-dimensional growth at submonolayer coverages of pentacene. Moreover, islands were found to preferentially nucleate at the location of the grafolds. We interpret this behavior in terms of increased chemical reactivity of grafolds that was predicted in previous theoretical works. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}

      \field{abstract}{Graphene is considered to be a promising candidate for future nanoelectronics due to its exceptional electronic properties. Unfortunately, the graphene field-effect transistors (PETs) cannot be turned off effectively due to the absence of a band gap. leading to an on/off current ratio typically around 5 in top-gated graphene FETs. On the other hand, theoretical investigations and optical measurements suggest that a band gap up to a few hundred millielectronvolts can be created by the perpendicular E-field in bilayer graphenes. Although previous carrier transport measurements in bilayer graphene transistors did indicate a gate-induced Insulating state at temperatures below 1 K, the electrical (or transport) band gap was estimated to be a few millielectronvolts, and the room temperature on/off current ratio in bilayer graphene FETs remains similar to those in single-layer graphene FETs. Here, for the first time, we report an on/off current ratio of around 100 and 2000 at room temperature and 20 K, respectively, in our dual-gate bilayer graphene FETs. We also measured an electrical band gap of > 130 and 80 meV at average electric displacements of 2.2 and 1.3 V nm-1, respectively. This demonstration reveals the great potential of bilayer graphene in applications such as digital electronics, pseudospintronics, terahertz technology, and infrared nanophotonics. © 2010 American Chemical Society.}

      \field{abstract}{Hormones within very low levels regulate and control the activity of specific cells and organs of the human body. Hormone imbalance can cause many diseases. Therefore, hormone detection tools have been developed, particularly over the last decade. Peptide hormones have a short half-life, so it is important to detect them within a short time. In this study, we report two types of peptide hormone sensors using human hormone receptor-carrying nanovesicles and graphene field-effect transistors (FETs). Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and glucagon (GCG) are peptide hormones present in human blood that act as ligands to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In this paper, the parathyroid hormone receptor (PTHR) and the glucagon receptor (GCGR) were expressed in human embryonic kidney-293 (HEK-293) cells, and were constructed as nanovesicles carrying the respective receptors. They were then immobilized onto graphene-based FETs. The two hormone sensors developed were able to detect each target hormone with high sensitivity (ca. 100 fM of PTH and 1 pM of GCG). Also, the sensors accurately recognized target hormones among different types of peptide hormones. In the development of hormone detection tools, this approach, using human hormone receptor-carrying nanovesicles and graphene FETs, offers the possibility of detecting very low concentrations of hormones in real-time.}

      \field{abstract}{The Dirac cone structure of the energy band of the single-layer graphene gives rise to ambipolar conduction which results from the conversion of the conductive carriers in graphene between electrons and holes under the effect of the electrical field. Therefore, the graphene field-effect transistor (GFET) exhibits a V-shaped transfer characteristic curve with an electron and hole conduction branch converting at a conductance minimum. However, in this paper, uniqueW-shaped σ-Vε curve with double conductance minima instead of the typical V-shaped one is observed in GFET based on chemical vapor deposition grown graphene, demonstrating a graphene p-n junction behavior. The observation is not expected from the energy band structure of graphene and probably results from the doping effect of the metal contact on the underlying graphene, which leads to a misalignment of the Fermi level between graphene under the metal contact and in the channel area, and ultimately induces the double conductance minima because of the formation of the graphene p-n junction.}

      \field{abstract}{We investigate the electrical properties in back-gated graphene field effect transistors (GFETs) with SiO2 dielectric and different thickness of high-k HfO2 dielectric. The results show that transform characteristic (Ids-Vgs) curves of GFETs are uniquely W-shaped with two charge neutrality point (left and right) in both SiO2 and HfO2 dielectric (SiO2-GFETs and HfO2-GFETs). The gate voltage reduces drastically in HfO2-GFETs compared with that in SiO2-GFETs, and it becomes much smaller with the decline of HfO2 thickness. The left charge neutrality point in Id-Vg curves of all HfO2-GFETs is negative, compared to the positive ones in SiO2-GFETs, which means that there exists n-doping in graphene with HfO2 as bottom dielectric. We speculate that this n-doping comes from the HfO2 layer, which brings fixed charged impurities in close proximity to graphene. The carrier mobility is also researched, demonstrating a decreasing trend of hole mobility in HfO2-GFETs contrast to that in SiO2-GFETs. In a series of HfO2-GFETs with different HfO2 dielectric thickness, the hole mobility shows a tendency of rise when the thickness decreases to 7 nm. The possible reason might be due to the introduced impurities into HfO2 film from atomic layer deposition process, the concentration of which varies from the thickness of HfO2 layer.}

      \field{abstract}{Numerous studies support the idea that carbon nanotubes can act as molecular quantum wires. The electronic properties of carbon nanotubes were first theorized by the Naval Research Laboratory's researchers. They theorized that even a small change in the winding hexagons along the nanotube can change it from a metal into a large-gap semiconductor. A group from Mildred Dresselhaus at MIT also predicted the electronic properties of carbon nanotubes. Later, studies contributed by researchers from Delft and the University of California, Berkeley found that it is possible for nanotubes to possess delocalized wavefunctions which allow them to behave like real quantum wires.}

      \field{abstract}{Computational simulation for predicting mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) has been adopted as a powerful tool relative to the experimental difficulty. Based on molecular mechanics, an improved 3D finite element (FE) model for armchair, zigzag and chiral single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) has been developed. The bending stiffness of the graphene layer has been considered. The potentials associated with the atomic interactions within a SWNT were evaluated by the strain energies of beam elements which serve as structural substitutions of covalent bonds. The out-of-plane deformation of the bonds was distinguished from the in-plane deformation by considering an elliptical cross-section for the beam elements. The elastic stiffness of graphene has been studied and the rolling energy per atom has been calculated through the analysis of rolling a graphene sheet into a SWNT to validate the proposed FE model. The effects of diameters and helicity on Young's modulus and the shear modulus of SWNTs were investigated. The simulation results from this work are comparable to both experimental tests and theoretical studies from the literatures. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

      \field{abstract}{THE synthesis of molecular carbon structures in the form of C60 and other fullerenes1 has stimulated intense interest in the structures accessible to graphitic carbon sheets. Here I report the preparation of a new type of finite carbon structure consisting of needle-like tubes. Produced using an arc-discharge evaporation method similar to that used for fullerene synthesis, the needles grow at the negative end of the electrode used for the arc discharge. Electron microscopy reveals that each needle comprises coaxial tubes of graphitic sheets, ranging in number from 2 up to about 50. On each tube the carbon-atom hexagons are arranged in a helical fashion about the needle axis. The helical pitch varies from needle to needle and from tube to tube within a single needle. It appears that this helical structure may aid the growth process. The formation of these needles, ranging from a few to a few tens of nanometres in diameter, suggests that engineering of carbon structures should be possible on scales considerably greater than those relevant to the fullerenes. On 7 November 1991, Sumio Iijima announced in Nature the preparation of nanometre-size, needle-like tubes of carbon — now familiar as 'nanotubes'. Used in microelectronic circuitry and microscopy, and as a tool to test quantum mechanics and model biological systems, nanotubes seem to have unlimited potential.}

      \field{abstract}{We fabricated field-effect transistors based on individual single- and multi-wall carbon nanotubes and analyzed their performance. Transport through the nanotubes is dominated by holes and, at room temperature, it appears to be diffusive rather than ballistic. By varying the gate voltage, we successfully modulated the conductance of a single-wall device by more than 5 orders of magnitude. Multi-wall nanotubes show typically no gate effect, but structural deformations - in our case a collapsed tube - can make them operate as field-effect transistors. © 1998 American Institute of Physics.}

      \field{abstract}{The use of individual molecules as functional electronic devices was first proposed in the 1970s (ref. 1). Since then, molecular electronics2,3 has attracted much interest, particularly because it could lead to conceptually new miniaturization strategies in the electronics and computer industry. The realization of single-molecule devices has remained challenging, largely owing to difficulties in achieving electrical contact to individual molecules. Recent advances in nanotechnology, however, have resulted in electrical measurements on single molecules4,5,6,7. Here we report the fabrication of a field-effect transistor—a three-terminal switching device—that consists of one semiconducting8,9,10 single-wall carbon nanotube11,12 connected to two metal electrodes. By applying a voltage to a gate electrode, the nanotube can be switched from a conducting to an insulating state. We have previously reported5 similar behaviour for a metallic single-wall carbon nanotube operated at extremely low temperatures. The present device, in contrast, operates at room temperature, thereby meeting an important requirement for potential practical applications. Electrical measurements on the nanotube transistor indicate that its operation characteristics can be qualitatively described by the semiclassical band-bending models currently used for traditional semiconductor devices. The fabrication of the three-terminal switching device at the level of a single molecule represents an important step towards molecular electronics.}

      \field{abstract}{Ultrathin, uniform single-walled carbon nanotube networks of varying densities have been fabricated at room temperature by a vacuum filtration method. Measurements of the sheet conductance as a function of nanotube network density show 2D percolation behavior. In addition, the network transparency in the visible spectral range was examined and the results are in agreement with a standard thin-film model: fits to the standard theory indicate σ ac = σ dc for transmission measurements at 550 nm. Transmission measurements also indicate the usefulness of nanotube network films as a transparent, conductive coating. Avenues for improvement of the network conductance are discussed.}

      \field{abstract}{Easily fabricated random network carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNT-FETs) have benefitted from improved separation techniques to deliver CNTs with current formulations providing at least 99\% semiconducting tube content. Amongst the most promising applications of this device platform are electronic biosensors, where the network conduction is affected through tethered probes such as aptamers which act as molecular scale electrostatic gates. However, the prevailing assumption that these biosensor devices would be optimized if metallic tubes were entirely eliminated has not been examined. Here, we show that metallic-semiconducting junctions in aptasensors are sensing hotspots and that their impact on sensing is heightened by the CNT network's proximity to percolation. First, we use a biased conducting AFM tip to gate a CNT-FET at the nanoscale and demonstrate that the strongest device response occurs when gating at metallic-semiconducting junctions. Second, we resolve the target sensitivity of an aptasensor as a function of tube density and show heightened sensitivity at densities close to the percolation threshold. We find the strongest sensing response where the 1\% of metallic tubes generate a high density of metallic-semiconducting junctions but cannot form a percolated metallic path across the network. These findings highlight the critical role of metallic tubes in CNT-FET biosensor devices and demonstrate that network composition is an important variable to boost the performance of electronic biosensors.}

      \field{abstract}{Point of care tests for measuring the concentration of small molecules such as oestradiol are both highly desirable for healthcare and challenging to design. Field effect transistors functionalised with DNA aptamers, FET aptasensors, are a promising candidate for such tests, however, the performance of FET aptasensors does not consistently keep pace with the performance of particular aptamers in isolation. To better understand the cause of this discrepancy, we compare the performance of two oestradiol aptamers in carbon nanotube network FET aptasensors, and further characterise these aptamers using circular dichroism spectroscopy. We show that both aptamers work effectively as sensors at a much higher analyte concentration, 10−6 M, than would be predicted by published Kd values, approximately 10−8 M. We show qualitatively different behaviour between otherwise identical sensors based on the aptamer they are functionalised with, at analyte concentrations well below the limit of detection. Our results suggest that the discrepancy between predicted and realised performance of carbon nanotube network FET aptasensors has two contributing factors: the difference between the ionic environment used for sensing and the environment the aptamers have been characterised in, and the use of SELEX methods that produce aptamers with minimal structure shift on binding. To optimise the sensing response from FET aptasensors, aptamers should be selected for large structure shifts upon binding, and so that they exhibit strong binding in the ionic environment that will be used for sensing.}

      \field{abstract}{Junctions consisting of two crossed single-walled carbon nanotubes were fabricated with electrical contacts at each end of each nanotube. The individual nanotubes were identified as metallic (M) or semiconducting (S), based on their two-terminal conductances; MM, MS, and SS four-terminal devices were studied. The MM and SS junctions had high conductances, on the order of 0.1 e2/h (where e is the electron charge and h is Planck's constant). For an MS junction, the semiconducting nanotube was depleted at the junction by the metallic nanotube, forming a rectifying Schottky barrier. We used two- and three-terminal experiments to fully characterize this junction.}

      \field{abstract}{Carbon nanotube network field effect transistors (CNTN-FETs) are promising candidates for low cost macroelectronics. We investigate the microscopic transport in these devices using electric force microscopy and simulations. We find that in many CNTN-FETs the voltage drops abruptly at a point in the channel where the current is constricted to just one tube. We also model the effect of varying the semiconducting/ metallic tube ratio. The effect of Schottky barriers on both conductance within semiconducting tubes and conductance between semiconducting and metallic tubes results in three possible types of CNTN-FETs with fundamentally different gating mechanisms. We describe this with an electronic phase diagram. © 2009 American Chemical Society.}

      \field{abstract}{With the advances in the separation and purification of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), the use of highly pure metallic or semiconducting CNTs has practical merit in electronics applications. When highly pure CNTs are applied in various fields, CNT networks are preferred to individual CNTs. In such cases, the presence of an electrical path becomes crucial in the network. In this study, we report on the electrical percolation thresholds of semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotube (s-SWCNT) networks, and their electrical characteristics in field-effect transistors (FET). Using the Monte Carlo method, s-SWCNT networks were randomly generated in the channels defined by the source–drain electrodes of the FET. On the basis of percolation theory, the percolation thresholds of s-SWCNT networks were obtained at different channel lengths (2, 6, and 10 μm) by generating random s-SWCNT networks 100 times. The network density corresponding to the electrical percolation threshold was theoretically gained at each channel length. As a result, the network densities at the percolation thresholds for the channel lengths of 2, 6, and 10 μm were 6.8, 9.0, and 9.9 tube μm−2, respectively. In addition, SPICE calculations were performed for each s-SWCNT network, constituting an electrical path between the source and the drain electrodes of the FET. In all channel lengths, the on/off ratio of the s-SWCNT networks was enhanced with increasing network density. Finally, we found a power law relationship between the on/off ratio of the s-SWCNT networks and the network density at the percolation threshold.}

      \field{abstract}{We report a numerical study of the tunnel conductance through the Schottky barrier at the contact between a semiconducting carbon nanotube and a metal electrode. In a planar gate model the asymmetry between the p-doped and the n-doped region is shown to depend mainly on the difference between the electrode Fermi level and the band gap of carbon nanotubes. We quantitatively show how the gate/nanotube distance is important to get large on-off ratios. We explain the bend of the current versus gate voltage as the transition from a thermal-activation region to a tunneling region. A good agreement is obtained with experimental results for carbon nanotubes field-effect transistors.}

      \field{abstract}{Carbon nanotube transistors have outstanding potential for electronic detection of biomolecules in solution. The physical mechanism underlying sensing however remains controversial, which hampers full exploitation of these promising nanosensors. Previously suggested mechanisms are electrostatic gating, changes in gate coupling, carrier mobility changes, and Schottky barrier effects. We argue that each mechanism has its characteristic effect on the liquid gate potential dependence of the device conductance. By studying both the electron and hole conduction, the sensing mechanisms can be unambiguously identified. From extensive protein-adsorption experiments on such devices, we find that electrostatic gating and Schottky barrier effects are the two relevant mechanisms, with electrostatic gating being most reproducible. If the contact region is passivated, sensing is shown to be dominated by electrostatic gating, which demonstrates that the sensitive part of a nanotube transistor is not limited to the contact region, as previously suggested. Such a layout provides a reliable platform for biosensing with nanotubes. © 2008 American Chemical Society.}

      \field{abstract}{While the potential for high mobility printed semiconducting nanotube inks has been clear for over a decade, a myriad of scientific and technological issues has prevented commercialization and practical use. One of the most challenging scientific problems has been to understand the relationship between the pristine, individual nanotube mobility (known to be in the 10 000 cm 2/V.s range) and the as-deposited random network mobility (recently demonstrated in the 100 cm2/V.s range). An additional significant scientific hurdle has been to understand, manage, and ultimately eliminate the effects of metallic nanotubes on the network performance, specifically the on/off ratio. Additional scientific progress is important in understanding the dependence of nanotube length, diameter, and density on device performance. Finally, the development of ink formulations that are of practical use in manufacturing is of paramount importance, especially with regard to drying time and uniformity, and ultimately, the issue of scalability and cost must be addressed. Many of these issues have recently been investigated from a phenomenological point of view, and a comprehensive understanding is beginning to emerge. In this paper, we present an overview of solution-based printed carbon nanotube devices and discuss long-term technology prospects. While significant technical challenges still remain, it is clear that the prospects for the use of nanotube ink in a myriad of systems is feasible given their unmatched mobility and compatibility with heterogeneous integration into a variety of applications in printed and flexible electronics. © 2011 American Chemical Society.}

      \field{abstract}{We present an experimental and theoretical characterization for reduced Graphene-Oxide (rGO) based FETs used for biosensing applications. The presented approach shows a complete result analysis and theoretically predictable electrical properties. The formulation was tested for the analysis of the device performance in the liquid gate mode of operation with variation of the ionic strength and pH-values of the electrolytes in contact with the FET. The dependence on the Debye length was confirmed experimentally and theoretically, utilizing the Debye length as a working parameter and thus defining the limits of applicability for the presented rGO-FETs. Furthermore, the FETs were tested for the sensing of biomolecules (bovine serum albumin (BSA) as reference) binding to gate-immobilized anti-BSA antibodies and analyzed using the Langmuir binding theory for the description of the equilibrium surface coverage as a function of the bulk (analyte) concentration. The obtained binding coefficients for BSA are found to be same as in results from literature, hence confirming the applicability of the devices. The FETs used in the experiments were fabricated using wet-chemically synthesized graphene, displaying high electron and hole mobility (μ) and provide the strong sensitivity also for low potential changes (by change of pH, ion concentration, or molecule adsorption). The binding coefficient for BSA-anti-BSA interaction shows a behavior corresponding to the Langmuir adsorption theory with a Limit of Detection (LOD) in the picomolar concentration range. The presented approach shows high reproducibility and sensitivity and a good agreement of the experimental results with the calculated data.}

      \field{abstract}{Since the mid-20th Century the electronics industry has enjoyed phenomenal growth and is now the largest industry in the world. The foundation of the electronics industry is the semiconductor device. To meet the tremendous demand of this industry, the semiconductor-device field has also grown rapidly. Coincident with this growth, the semiconductor-device literature has expanded and diversified. For access to this massive amount of information, there is a need for a book giving a comprehen- sive introductory account of device physics and operational principles. With the intention of meeting such a need, the First Edition and the Second Edition of Physics of Semiconductor Devices were published in 1969 and 198 1, respectively. It is perhaps somewhat surprising that the book has so long held its place as one of the main textbooks for advanced undergraduate and graduate students in applied physics, electrical and electronics engineering, and materials science. Because the book includes much useful information on material parameters and device physics, it is also a major reference for engineers and scientists in semicon- ductor-device research and development. To date, the book is one of the most, if not the most, cited works in contemporary engineering and applied science with over 15,000 citations (ISI, Thomson Scientific). Since 198 1, more than 250,000 papers on semiconductor devices have been pub- lished, with numerous breakthroughs in device concepts and performances. The book clearly needed another major revision if it were to continue to serve its purpose. In this Third Edition of Physics of Semiconductor Devices, over 50\% of the material has been revised or updated, and the material has been totally reorganized. We have retained the basic physics of classic devices and added many sections that are of con- temporary interest such as the three-dimensional MOSFETs, nonvolatile memory, modulation-doped field-effect transistor, single-electron transistor, resonant-tun- neling diode, insulated-gate bipolar transistor, quantum cascade laser, semiconductor sensors, and so on. On the other hand, we have omitted or reduced sections of less- important topics to maintain the overall book length. We have added a problem set at the end of each chapter. The problem set forms an integral part of the development of the topics, and some problems can be used as worked examples in the classroom. A complete set of detailed solutions to all end-of- chapter problems has been prepared. The solution manuals are available free to all adopting faculties. The figures and tables used in the text are also available, in elec- tronic format, to instructors from the publisher. Instructors can find out more informa- tion at the publisher’s website at http://ww.wiley.com/interscience/sze. In the course of writing this text, we had the fortune of help and support of many people. First we express our gratitude to the management of our academic and indus- trial institutions, the National Chiao Tung University, the National Nan0 Device Lab- oratories, Agere Systems, and MVC, without whose support this book could not have been written.

      \field{abstract}{The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for real-time biosensing with liquid-gated carbon nanotube transistors is crucial for exploring the limits of their sensitivity, but has not been studied thus far. Although biosensing is often performed at high transconductance where the device displays the largest gate response, here we show that the maximum SNR is actually obtained when the device is operated in the subthreshold regime. In the ON-state, additional contributions to the noise can lead to a reduction of the SNR by up to a factor of 5. For devices with passivated contact regions, the SNR in ON-state is even further reduced than for bare devices. We show that when the conductivity of the contact regions can be increased usiπg a conventional back gate, the SNR in the ON-state can be improved. The results presented here demonstrate that biosensing experiments are best performed in the subthreshold regime for optimal SNR.}

      \field{abstract}{Nanowire field-effect transistors (NW-FETs) are emerging as powerful sensors for detection of chemical/biological species with various attractive features including high sensitivity and direct electrical readout. Yet to date there have been limited systematic studies addressing how the fundamental factors of devices affect their sensitivity. Here we demonstrate that the sensitivity of NW-FET sensors can be exponentially enhanced in the subthreshold regime where the gating effect of molecules bound on a surface is the most effective due to the reduced screening of carriers in NWs. This principle is exemplified in both pH and protein sensing experiments where the operational mode of NW-FET biosensors was tuned by electrolyte gating. The lowest charge detectable by NW-FET sensors working under different operational modes is also estimated. Our work shows that optimization of NW-FET structure and operating conditions can provide significant enhancement and fundamental understanding for the sensitivity limits of NW-FET sensors.}

      \field{abstract}{Chemical sensors based on individual single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are demonstrated. Upon exposure to gaseous molecules such as NO2 or NH3, the electrical resistance of a semiconducting SWNT is found to dramatically increase or decrease. This serves as the basis for nanotube molecular sensors. The nanotube sensors exhibit a fast response and a substantially higher sensitivity than that of existing solid-state sensors at room temperature. Sensor reversibility is achieved by slow recovery under ambient conditions or by heating to high temperatures. The interactions between molecular species and SWNTs and the mechanisms of molecular sensing with nanotube molecular wires are investigated.}

      \field{abstract}{Single-walled carbon nanotube (CNT) based gas sensors have enormous potential in pollution monitoring in low concentration level because of its high sensitivity, fast response, and physical/chemical stability. However, the lack of selectivity has been a major drawback for its wide range employment. In this work, we fabricate thin film transistors (TFTs) using randomly distributed CNTs and investigate them for ammonia and nitrogen dioxide detection in air at low ppm concentrations. A sensing mechanism is proposed based on the interaction between gas molecules and different types of dwelling spots inside the channel area of a TFT. We present double exponential-convolution model to decipher sensor response as well as to explore its application in gas identification. In this context, the consistency in time constants is recognized, which is independent of gas concentration. More importantly, the time constants vary with respect to different gas types and TFTs. The uniqueness of time constants can work as identity verification for different sensing gases, which demonstrates that the sensor response is a distinctive behavior determined by the unique channel structure of each TFT. This work provides us a general strategy for gas identification in ppm level and a practical path to realize the advantages of CNT gas sensors in air quality detection as well as the industrial emission control.}

      \field{abstract}{A comparative study was made of sorted semi-conducting single walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films and unsorted SWCNT films for gas sensing applications. The transmission line method is used to monitor separately the SWCNTs film resistance and the contact resistance between electrodes and the SWCNTs, thus revealing that the sensing mechanism mainly relies on a modification of the tube conductivity during gas exposure. The fabricated sensors demonstrate a detection limit of 20 ppb NO2 and 600 ppb NH3 mainly attributed to experimental setup limitations. Moreover, semi-conducting nanotubes happened to be 2.5 times more sensitive to NH3 than unsorted ones, thus proving that selectivity can be improved by sorting the SWCNTs. The temperature dependence of the sensor sensitivity was studied, and a good agreement was found between experimental results and the Langmuir adsorption model. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

      \field{abstract}{Gas sensing in carbon nanotubes is still poorly understood. Possible mechanisms are charge transfer between adsorbed gas molecules and the nanotubes or gas-induced changes at the interface between the nanotubes and their metal contacts. For carbon nanotube networks, it is also important to understand how defects and junctions formed by crossing nanotubes affect adsorption. Previous work demonstrates that for devices made with a single carbon nanotube, the response was mainly due to modifications at the nanotube/metal contact interfaces rather than molecular adsorption on the nanotube. Here it is shown that in networks of carbon nanotubes the gas sensitivity is due to both the nanotube/metal contacts and the carbon nanotube network. The network effects are dominated by gas-induced changes in nanotube/nanotube junctions, rather than gas adsorption on regions of the nanotubes away from the junctions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

      \field{abstract}{Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) promise to advance a number of real-world technologies. Of these applications, they are particularly attractive for uses in chemical sensors for environmental and health monitoring. However, chemical sensors based on CNTs are often lacking in selectivity, and the elucidation of their sensing mechanisms remains challenging. This review is a comprehensive description of the parameters that give rise to the sensing capabilities of CNT-based sensors and the application of CNT-based devices in chemical sensing. This review begins with the discussion of the sensing mechanisms in CNT-based devices, the chemical methods of CNT functionalization, architectures of sensors, performance parameters, and theoretical models used to describe CNT sensors. It then discusses the expansive applications of CNT-based sensors to multiple areas including environmental monitoring, food and agriculture applications, biological sensors, and national security. The discussion of each analyte focuses on the strategies used to impart selectivity and the molecular interactions between the selector and the analyte. Finally, the review concludes with a brief outlook over future developments in the field of chemical sensors and their prospects for commercialization.}

      \field{abstract}{There is an explosive interest in ID nanostructured materials for biological sensors. Among these nanometer-scale materials, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) offer the advantages of possible biocompatibility, size compatibility, and sensitivity towards minute electrical perturbations. In particular, because of these inherent qualities, changes in SWNT conductivity have been explored in order to study the interaction of biomolecules with SWNTs. This Review discusses these interactions, with a focus on carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (NTFETs). Recent examples of applications of NTFET devices for detection of proteins, antibody-antigen assays, DNA hybridization, and enzymatic reactions involving glucose are summarized. Examples of complementary techniques, such as microscopy and spectroscopy, are covered as well. © 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA.}

      \field{abstract}{A label-free immunosensor based on an aptamer-modified graphene field-effect transistor (G-FET) is demonstrated. Immunoglobulin E (IgE) aptamers with an approximate height of 3 nm were successfully immobilized on a graphene surface, as confirmed by atomic force microscopy. The aptamer-modified G-FET showed selective electrical detection of IgE protein. From the dependence of the drain current variation on the IgE concentration, the dissociation constant was estimated to be 47 nM, indicating good affinity and the potential for G-FETs to be used in biological sensors. © 2010 American Chemical Society.}

      \field{abstract}{Novel nanomaterials for bioassay applications represent a rapidly progressing field of nanotechnology and nanobiotechnology. Here, we present an exploration of single-walled carbon nanotubes as a platform for investigating surface-protein and protein-protein binding and developing highly specific electronic biomolecule detectors. Nonspecific binding on nanotubes, a phenomenon found with a wide range of proteins, is overcome by immobilization of polyethylene oxide chains. A general approach is then advanced to enable the selective recognition and binding of target proteins by conjugation of their specific receptors to polyethylene oxide-functionalized nanotubes. This scheme, combined with the sensitivity of nanotube electronic devices, enables highly specific electronic sensors for detecting clinically important biomolecules such as antibodies associated with human autoimmune diseases.}

      \field{abstract}{Glutamate is the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, and its excessive release plays a key role in neuronal death associated with a wide range of neural disorders. Real time monitoring of extracellular glutamate levels would be very helpful in understanding the excitotoxic process of neurotransmitters, as well as brain injury during or after surgery. In order to detect l-glutamate, we immobilized l-glutamate oxidase (GLOD) on carbon nanotube (CNT) network junctions by a non-covalent functionalized method to preserve their electronic characteristics. After immobilizing GLOD on the CNT network, the excess reactive groups of linker molecule remaining on its surface were deactivated and blocked by ethanolamine. The electrical property of the GLOD-immobilized CNT network transistor was characterized as source-drain current that depended on liquid gate voltage. From the changes in the Isd vs. Vg plot about the CNT network transistor before and after the immobilization of GLOD, we confirmed that GLOD immobilization decreased the conductance of CNT network junctions, regardless of the sign on the net charge in the protein. The real time electronic response of the GLOD-coated CNT network transistor was conducted with a glutamate standard solution in vitro and the 11 vessel occlusion (11VO) rat model in vivo. The ultrahigh sensitivity, selectivity, and fast response time of GLOD-immobilized CNT-FET could provide great potential for the real time electronic detection of extracellular glutamate levels in the brain. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

      \field{abstract}{Noninvasive glucose detections are convenient techniques for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, which require high performance glucose sensors. However, conventional electrochemical glucose sensors are not sensitive enough for these applications. Here, highly sensitive glucose sensors are successfully realized based on whole-graphene solution-gated transistors with the graphene gate electrodes modified with an enzyme glucose oxidase. The sensitivity of the devices is dramatically improved by co-modifying the graphene gates with Pt nanoparticles due to the enhanced electrocatalytic activity of the electrodes. The sensing mechanism is attributed to the reaction of H2O2 generated by the oxidation of glucose near the gate. The optimized glucose sensors show the detection limits down to 0.5 μM and good selectivity, which are sensitive enough for non-invasive glucose detections in body fluids. The devices show the transconductances two orders of magnitude higher than that of a conventional silicon field effect transistor, which is the main reason for their high sensitivity. Moreover, the devices can be conveniently fabricated with low cost. Therefore, the whole-graphene solution-gated transistors are a high-performance sensing platform for not only glucose detections but also many other types of biosensors that may find practical applications in the near future.}

      \field{abstract}{We present a monolithic biosensor platform, based on carbon-nanotube field-effect transistors (CNTFETs), for the detection of the neurotransmitter glutamate. We used an array of 9′216 CNTFET devices with 96 integrated readout and amplification channels that was realized in complementary metal-oxide semiconductor technology (CMOS). The detection principle is based on amperometry, where electrochemically active hydrogen peroxide, a product of the enzymatic reaction of the target analyte and an enzyme that was covalently bonded to the CNTFET, modulated the conductance of the CNTFET-based sensors. We assessed the performance of the CNTs as enzymatic sensors by evaluating the minimal resolvable concentration change of glutamate in aqueous solutions. The minimal resolvable concentration change amounted to 10 µM of glutamate, which was one of the best values reported for CMOS-based systems so far.}

      \field{abstract}{We report a method to build ultrasensitive carbon nanotube-based biosensors using immune binding reaction. Here carbon nanotube-field effect transistors (CNT-FETs) were functionalized with antibody-binding fragments as a receptor, and the binding event of target immunoglobulin G (IgG) onto the fragments was detected by monitoring the gating effect caused by the charges of the target IgG. Because the biosensors were used in buffer solution, it was crucial to use small-size receptors so that the charged target IgG could approach the CNT surface within the Debye length distance to give a large gating effect. The results show that CNT-FET biosensors using whole antibody had very low sensitivity (detection limit ∼1000 ng/ml), whereas those based on small Fab fragments could detect 1 pg/ml (∼7 fM level). Moreover, our Fab-modified CNT-FET could successfully block the nontarget proteins and could selectively detect the target protein in an environment similar to that of human serum electrolyte. Significantly, this strategy can be applied to general antibody-based detection schemes, and it should enable the production of label-free ultrasensitive electronic biosensors to detect clinically important biomarkers for disease diagnosis. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

      \field{abstract}{Airborne fungus, including Aspergillus species, is one of the major causes of human asthma. Conventional immunoassay or DNA-sequencing techniques, although widely used, are usually labor-intensive, time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we demonstrate a sensor for the rapid detection of Aspergillus niger, a well-known allergenic fungal species, using single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) field effect transistors (FETs) functionalized with pentameric antibodies that specifically bind to Aspergillus species. This strategy resulted in the real time and highly sensitive and selective detection of Aspergillus due to an electrostatic gating effect from the Aspergillus fungus. This mechanism is in contrast to a previously reported Aspergillus sensor, which was based on mobility modulation from Aspergillus adsorption. Also, our sensor shows a much wider detection range from 0.5 pg mL−1 to 10 μg mL−1 with a lower detection limit of 0.3 pg mL−1. The resulting SWNT-FET was able to selectively detect Aspergillus molds in the presence of more concentrated amounts of other mold species such as Alternaria alternata, Cladosporium cladosporioides, and Penicillium chrysogenum. We expect that our results can be used in real-time monitoring of the indoor air quality of a variety of public facilities for the elderly and children, who are more vulnerable to environmental biohazards.}

      \field{abstract}{A graphene field-effect transistor (gFET) was non-covalently functionalised with 1-pyrenebutyric acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester and conjugated with anti-CD63 antibodies for the label-free detection of exosomes. Using a microfluidic channel, part of a graphene film was exposed to solution. The change in electrical properties of the exposed graphene created an additional minimum alongside the original Dirac point in the drain-source current (Ids) - back-gate voltage (Vg) curve. When phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was present in the channel, the additional minimum was present at a Vg lower than the original Dirac point and shifted with time when exosomes were introduced into the channel. This shift of the minimum from the PBS reference point reached saturation after 30 minutes and was observed for multiple exosome concentrations. Upon conjugation with an isotype control, sensor response to the highest concentration of exosomes was negligible in comparison to that with anti-CD63 antibody, indicating that the functionalised gFET can specifically detect exosomes at least down to 0.1 μg/mL and is sensitive to concentration. Such a gFET biosensor has not been used before for exosome sensing and could be an effective tool for the liquid-biopsy detection of exosomes as biomarkers for early-stage identification of diseases such as cancer.}

      \field{abstract}{We have fabricated label-free protein biosensors based on aptamer-modified carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNT-FETs) for the detection of immunoglobulin E (IgE). After the covalent immobilization of 5′-amino-modified 45-mer aptamers on the CNT channels, the electrical properties of the CNT-FETs were monitored in real time. The introduction of target IgE at various concentrations caused a sharp decrease in the source-drain current, and a gradual saturation was observed at lower concentrations. The amount of the net source-drain current before and after IgE introduction on the aptamer-modified CNT-FETs increased as a function of IgE concentration. The detection limit for IgE was determined as 250 pM. We have also prepared CNT-FET biosensors using a monoclonal antibody against IgE (IgE-mAb). The electrical properties of the aptamer- and antibody-modified CNT-FETs were compared. The performance of aptamer-modified CNT-FETs provided better results than the ones obtained using IgE-mAb-modified CNT-FETs under similar conditions. Thus, we suggest that the aptamer-modified CNT-FETs are promising candidates for the development of label-free protein biosensors. © 2007 American Chemical Society.}

      \field{abstract}{Carbon nanotube field effect transistor (CNT FET) aptasensors have been investigated for the detection of adenosine using two different aptamer sequences, a 35-mer and a 27-mer. We found limits of detection for adenosine of 100 pM and 320 nM for the 35-mer and 27-mer aptamers, with dissociation constants of 1.2 nM and 160 nM, respectively. Upon analyte recognition the 35-mer adenosine aptamer adopts a compact G-quadruplex structure while the 27-mer adenosine aptamer changes to a folded duplex. Using the CNT FET aptasensor platform adenosine could be detected with high sensitivity over the range of 100 pM to 10 µM, highlighting the suitability of the CNT FET aptasensor platform for high performance adenosine detection. The aptamer restructuring format is critical for high sensitivity with the G-quadraplex aptasensor having a 130-fold smaller dissociation constant than the duplex forming aptasensor.}

      \field{abstract}{We developed a nanovesicle-based bioelectronic nose (NBN) that could recognize a specific odorant and mimic the receptor-mediated signal transmission of human olfactory systems. To build an NBN, we combined a single-walled carbon nanotube-based field effect transistor with cell-derived nanovesicles containing human olfactory receptors and calcium ion signal pathways. Importantly, the NBN took advantages of cell signal pathways for sensing signal amplification, enabling ∼100 times better sensitivity than that of previous bioelectronic noses based on only olfactory receptor protein and carbon nanotube transistors. The NBN sensors exhibited a human-like selectivity with single-carbon-atomic resolution and a high sensitivity of 1. fM detection limit. Moreover, this sensor platform could mimic a receptor-meditated cellular signal transmission in live cells. This sensor platform can be utilized for the study of molecular recognition and biological processes occurring at cell membranes and also for various practical applications such as food screening and medical diagnostics. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.}

      \field{abstract}{Single-walled carbon nanotubes (swCNTs) hold great promise for use as molecular wires because they exhibit high electrical conductivity and chemical stability. However, constructing swCNT-based transducer devices requires controlled strategies for assembling biomolecules on swCNTs. In this study, we proposed a chemically modified swCNT. The swCNT was functionalized with 1,5-diaminonaphthalene via π-stacking, for reliable attachment of the human olfactory receptor 2AG1 (hOR2AG1). The human olfactory receptor was then anchored. We investigated the use of this functionalized CNT in the fabrication of a highly sensitive and selective bioelectronic nose. For the bioelectronic nose, the swCNT-field effect transistor (FET) platform was composed of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated regions to prevent non-specific absorption and chemically modified swCNTs regions containing hOR2AG1, which can bind to the specific odorant. This approach allowed us to create well-defined micron-scale patterns of hOR2AG1 on the swCNTs. Our bioelectronic nose displayed ultrahigh sensitivity down to concentrations as low as 1. fM due to the enhanced hOR2AG1-odorant interaction through the tight binding of hOR2AG1 on the chemically modified swCNTs. In addition, the approach described here may provide an alternative route for multiplexed detection of diverse odorants and to improve the sensitivity of sensor devices. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.}

      \field{abstract}{Rapid and precise discrimination of various odorants is vital to fabricating enhanced sensing devices in the fields of disease diagnostics, food safety, and environmental monitoring. Here, we demonstrate an ultrasensitive and flexible field-effect transistor (FET) olfactory system, namely, a bioelectronic nose (B-nose), based on plasma-treated bilayer graphene conjugated with an olfactory receptor. The stable p- and n-type behaviors from modified bilayer graphene (MBLG) took place after controlled oxygen and ammonia plasma treatments. It was integrated with human olfactory receptors 2AG1 (hOR2AG1: OR), leading to the formation of the liquid-ion gated FET-type platform. ORs bind to the particular odorant amyl butyrate (AB), and their interactions are specific and selective. The B-noses behave as flexible and transparent sensing devices and can recognize a target odorant with single-carbon-atom resolution. The B-noses are ultrasensitive and highly selective toward AB. The minimum detection limit (MDL) is as low as 0.04 fM (10 -15; signal-to-noise: 4.2), and the equilibrium constants of OR-oxygen plasma-treated graphene (OR-OG) and ammonia plasma-treated graphene (-NG) are ca. 3.44 × 10 14 and 1.47 × 10 14 M -1, respectively. Additionally, the B-noses have long-term stability and excellent mechanical bending durability in flexible systems. © 2012 American Chemical Society.}

Olfactory and taste cell sensor is one kind of cell-based on biosensors which are based on the electronic nose and electronic tongue research, trying to culture olfactory and taste living cell on the surface of chips. This is a really mimicking bioelectronic nose and tongue technology, which can detect odors and taste by using chips such as light-addressable potentiometric sensor to record action potential representing the odorants and taste in cell membrane. Now, several kinds of cells from olfactory bulb and taste bud on chip have been cultured, while the experiments and analysis about the detection of olfactory and taste and its action potential under the stimulus of different odors and taste also are in progress. © 2007.}

      \field{abstract}{An olfactory biosensor based on a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) field-effect transistor (FET), functionalized by the odorant-binding protein 14 (OBP14) from the honey bee (Apis mellifera) has been designed for the in situ and real-time monitoring of a broad spectrum of odorants in aqueous solutions known to be attractants for bees. The electrical measurements of the binding of all tested odorants are shown to follow the Langmuir model for ligand-receptor interactions. The results demonstrate that OBP14 is able to bind odorants even after immobilization on rGO and can discriminate between ligands binding within a range of dissociation constants from Kd=4 μM to Kd=3.3 mM. The strongest ligands, such as homovanillic acid, eugenol, and methyl vanillate all contain a hydroxy group which is apparently important for the strong interaction with the protein.}

      \field{abstract}{We describe the fabrication and performance of a biosensor for odorants, using wildtype and engineered mutants of the Italian honeybee (Apis mellifera ligustica) odorant binding protein 14 (OBP14), immobilized onto a reduced graphene oxide field-effect transistor (rGO-FET). The binding properties of the protein when immobilized on the biosensor are similar to those measured in solution, thus providing a method for measuring affinities to small molecules as an alternative to the current fluorescence assay. Out of the 14 chemicals tested, the best ligands for wildtype OBP14 were eugenol, homovanillic acid and related compounds sharing a phenol-methoxy backbone. Other chemicals, including methyl eugenol, showed affinities to OBP14 100–1000 times lower. We have also tested two mutants of OBP14. The first, bearing a HisTag at its N-terminus for better orientation on the sensor surface, showed only minor differences in its binding properties for chemicals when compared to the wildtype. The second contained an additional disulfide bond between helices α3 and α6, thus reducing the dynamics of OBP14 and leading to a higher affinity for eugenol. These data also demonstrate that it is feasible to produce biosensors with desired ligand specificities by introducing selected mutations into the structure of OBPs or other active proteins.}

      \field{abstract}{The mammalian olfactory system can recognize and discriminate a large number of different odorant molecules. The detection of chemically distinct odorants presumably results from the association of odorous ligands with specific receptors on olfactory sensory neurons. To address the problem of olfactory perception at a molecular level, we have cloned and characterized 18 different members of an extremely large multigene family that encodes seven transmembrane domain proteins whose expression is restricted to the olfactory epithelium. The members of this novel gene family are likely to encode a diverse family of odorant receptors. © 1991.}

      \field{abstract}{The majority of insect olfactory receptors belong to two distinct protein families, the ionotropic receptors (IRs), which are related to the ionotropic glutamate receptor family, and the odorant receptors (ORs), which evolved from the gustatory receptor family. Both receptor types assemble to heteromeric ligand-gated cation channels composed of odor-specific receptor proteins and co-receptor proteins. We here present in short the current view on evolution, function, and regulation of IRs and ORs. Special attention is given on how their functional properties can meet the environmental and ecological challenges an insect has to face.}

      \field{abstract}{G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest superfamily of transmembrane proteins and the targets of over 30\% of currently marketed pharmaceuticals. Although several structures have been solved for GPCR–G protein complexes, few are in a lipid membrane environment. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of complexes of neurotensin, neurotensin receptor 1 and Gαi1β1γ1 in two conformational states, resolved to resolutions of 4.1 and 4.2 Å. The structures, determined in a lipid bilayer without any stabilizing antibodies or nanobodies, reveal an extended network of protein–protein interactions at the GPCR–G protein interface as compared to structures obtained in detergent micelles. The findings show that the lipid membrane modulates the structure and dynamics of complex formation and provide a molecular explanation for the stronger interaction between GPCRs and G proteins in lipid bilayers. We propose an allosteric mechanism for GDP release, providing new insights into the activation of G proteins for downstream signaling.}

      \field{abstract}{The sensing of vapor odorants is highly demanded in the field of life and medical sciences. Although olfactory receptors (ORs) have potentials to recognize volatile organic compounds, the interaction of ORs, chemical vapors, and peptide components in olfactory mucus has yet to be analyzed to develop OR-based sensors. A bioinspired electrophysiology technique is shown to record the response of reconstituted insect ORs to chemical vapors. To mimic the interface between ORs and olfactory mucus, OR expressing spheroids were loaded into a hydrogel microchamber array. A negative extracellular field potential shift of spheroids was successfully observed by the stimulation of their vapor cognate ligand. Importantly, the ligand repertoire of the OR of malaria vector mosquito examined by this method differed from that of in vivo studies. Our method is useful to develop protein-based gas sensing techniques and to examine the binding of ORs and chemical vapors.}

      \field{abstract}{Artificial noses are broad-spectrum multisensors dedicated to the detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Despite great recent progress, they still suffer from a lack of sensitivity and selectivity. We will review, in a systemic way, the biomimetic strategies for improving these performance criteria, including the design of sensing materials, their immobilization on the sensing surface, the sampling of VOCs, the choice of a transduction method, and the data processing. This reflection could help address new applications in domains where high-performance artificial noses are required such as public security and safety, environment, industry, or healthcare.}

      \field{abstract}{Insects have co-opted a unique family of seven transmembrane proteins for odour sensing. Odorant receptors are believed to have evolved from gustatory receptors somewhere at the base of the Hexapoda and have expanded substantially to become the dominant class of odour recognition elements within the Insecta. These odorant receptors comprise an obligate co-receptor, Orco, and one of a family of highly divergent odorant "tuning" receptors. The two subunits are thought to come together at some as-yet unknown stoichiometry to form a functional complex that is capable of both ionotropic and metabotropic signalling. While there are still no 3D structures for these proteins, site-directed mutagenesis, resonance energy transfer, and structural modelling efforts, all mainly on Drosophila odorant receptors, are beginning to inform hypotheses of their structures and how such complexes function in odour detection. Some of the loops, especially the second extracellular loop that has been suggested to form a lid over the binding pocket, and the extracellular regions of some transmembrane helices, especially the third and to a less extent the sixth and seventh, have been implicated in ligand recognition in tuning receptors. The possible interaction between Orco and tuning receptor subunits through the final intracellular loop and the adjacent transmembrane helices is thought to be important for transducing ligand binding into receptor activation. Potential phosphorylation sites and a calmodulin binding site in the second intracellular loop of Orco are also thought to be involved in regulating channel gating. A number of new methods have recently been developed to express and purify insect odorant receptor subunits in recombinant expression systems. These approaches are enabling high throughput screening of receptors for agonists and antagonists in cell-based formats, as well as producing protein for the application of biophysical methods to resolve the 3D structure of the subunits and their complexes.}

      \field{abstract}{A real-time sensor for the detection of amyl butyrate (AB) utilising human olfactory receptor 2AG1 (OR2AG1), a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) consisting of seven transmembrane domains, immobilized onto a graphene resistor is demonstrated. Using CVD graphene as the sensor platform, allows greater potential for more sensitive detection than similar sensors based on carbon nanotubes, gold or graphene oxide platforms. A specific graphene resistor sensor was fabricated and modified via non-covalent π–π stacking of 1,5 diaminonaphthalene (DAN) onto the graphene channel, and subsequent anchoring of the OR2AG1 receptor to the DAN molecule using glutaraldehyde coupling. Binding between the target odorant, amyl butyrate, and the OR2AG1 receptor protein generated a change in resistance of the graphene resistor sensor. The functionalized graphene resistor sensors exhibited a linear sensor response between 0.1–500 pM and high selectively towards amyl butyrate, with a sensitivity as low as 500 fM, whilst control measurements using non-specific esters, produced a negligible sensor response. The approach described here provides an alternative sensing platform that can be used in bioelectronic nose applications.}

Although the saturated ΔV th was larger on SiO 2 than on HfO 2, CNT device using SiO 2 gate insulator recovered their original characteristics after removal of the stress at room temperature without additional thermal and bias annealing.

      \field{abstract}{Dimetyl metylphosphonate (DMMP) is a simulant of sarin, which is a representative of nerve agents. Sarin is an organophosphorus toxic compound that is an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, paralyzing human neurotransmission and the autonomic nervous system. Detection of these nerve agents has been considered important for safety issues to prevent terrorism and to counter military threats. Although there have been various studies on sensors for detecting DMMP as a simulant of sarin, limitations still exist in specificity, sensitivity, and reliability. To overcome these limitations, we utilized a human olfactory receptor (hOR)-based single-walled carbon nanotube-field effect transistor (swCNT-FET) as a platform for the detection of DMMP. The hORs have high specificity for their certain target molecules. swCNT-FET can also convert biological signals of hORs to electrical signals with high sensitivity. By screening of hORs, hOR2T7 with high selectivity for DMMP was selected, and it was produced for development of the hOR2T7-conjugated bioelectronic nose (hOR2T7 B-nose). A hOR2T7 B-nose was able to selectively detect DMMP at a concentration of 10 fM. This shows ultrasensitive and selective performance for the detection of DMMP as a tool for sensing chemical warfare agents (CWAs), which could be used for practical applications in the field of safety.}

      \field{abstract}{Phospholipid bilayer Nanodiscs are novel model membranes derived from high-density lipoprotein particles and have proven to be useful in studies of membrane proteins. Membrane protein enzymology has been hampered by the inherent insolubility of membrane proteins in aqueous environments and has necessitated the use of model membranes such as liposomes and detergent-stabilized micelles. Current model membranes display a polydisperse particle size distribution and can suffer from problems of inconsistency and instability. It is also unclear how well they mimic biological lipid bilayers. In contrast, Nanodiscs, the particle size of which is constrained by a coat of scaffold proteins, are relatively monodisperse, stable model membranes with a "nativelike" lipid bilayer. Nanodiscs have already been used to study a variety of membrane proteins, including cytochrome P450s, seven-transmembrane proteins, and bacterial chemoreceptors. These proteins are simultaneously monomerized, solubilized, and incorporated into the well-defined membrane environment provided by Nanodiscs. Nanodiscs may also provide useful insights into the thermodynamics and biophysics of biological membranes and binding of small molecules to membranes. © 2007 American Chemical Society.}

      \field{abstract}{A human nose-mimetic diagnosis system that can distinguish the odor of a lung cancer biomarker, heptanal, from human blood is presented. Selective recognition of the biomarker is mimicked in the human olfactory system. A specific olfactory receptor recognizing the chemical biomarker is first selected through screening a library of human olfactory receptors (hORs). The selected hOR is expressed on the membrane of human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells. Nanovesicles containing the hOR on the membrane are produced from these cells, and are then used for the functionalization of single-walled carbon nanotubes. This strategy allows the development of a sensitive and selective nanovesicle-based bioelectronic nose (NvBN). The NvBN is able to selectively detect heptanal at a concentration as low as 1 × 10-14 m, a sufficient level to distinguish the blood of a lung cancer patient from the blood of a healthy person. In actual experiments, NvBN could detect an extremely small increase in the amount of heptanal from human blood plasma without any pretreatment processes. This result offers a rapid and easy method to analyze chemical biomarkers from human blood in real-time and to diagnose lung cancer. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim.}

      \field{abstract}{We have designed and implemented a practical nanoelectronic interface to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), a large family of membrane proteins whose roles in the detection of molecules outside eukaryotic cells make them important pharmaceutical targets. Specifically, we have coupled olfactory receptor proteins (ORs) with carbon nanotube transistors. The resulting devices transduce signals associated with odorant binding to ORs in the gas phase under ambient conditions and show responses that are in excellent agreement with results from established assays for OR-ligand binding. The work represents significant progress on a path toward a bioelectronic nose that can be directly compared to biological olfactory systems as well as a general method for the study of GPCR function in multiple domains using electronic readout. © 2011 American Chemical Society.}

      \field{abstract}{A simple but efficient measurement platform based on ion-channel-coupled receptors and nanovesicles was developed for monitoring the real-time activity of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In this work, an olfactory receptor (OR), the most common class A GPCR, was covalently fused with a Kir6.2 channel so that the GPCR action directly induced the opening of the ion channels and changes in the electrical membrane potential without complex cellular signaling processes. This strategy reduced the measurement errors caused by instability of various cellular components. In addition, rather than using whole cells, a cell-surface-derived nanovesicle was used to preserve the membrane-integrated structure of GPCRs and to exclude case-dependent cellular conditions. Another merit of using the nanovesicle is that nanovesicles can be easily combined with nanomaterial-based field-effect transistors (FETs) to build a sensitive and stable measurement platform to monitor GPCR activities with high sensitivity in real-time. Using a platform based on carbon nanotube FETs and nanovesicles carrying Kir6.2-channel-coupled ORs, we monitored the real-time response of ORs to their ligand molecules. Significantly, since this platform does not rely on rather unstable cell signaling pathways, our platform could be utilized for a rather long time period without losing its functionality. This system can be utilized extensively for simple and sensitive analysis of the activities of various GPCRs and should enable various academic and practical applications.}

      \field{abstract}{Nanomicelles are self‐assembling nanosized (usually with particle size within a range of 10 to 100 nm) colloidal dispersions with a hydrophobic core and hydrophilic shell. Owing to its size, solubility, customised surface or its exposure to the environment, nanomicelles show some unique or novel characteristics, which makes it multifunctional and thus makes its use indispensable in biomedical application and various other fields. This review presents the unique properties of nanomicelles that makes it different from other particles and paves its way to be used as drug delivery agent and many other biological uses or applications. It also emphasises on the drug encapsulation ability of the nanomicelles and different technique of drug loading and delivery along with its advantages and disadvantages.}

      \field{abstract}{Transdermal drug delivery systems have become an intriguing research topic in pharmaceutical technology area and one of the most frequently developed pharmaceutical products in global market. The use of these systems can overcome associated drawbacks of other delivery routes, such as oral and parenteral. The authors will review current trends, and future applications of transdermal technologies, with specific focus on providing a comprehensive understanding of transdermal drug delivery systems and enhancement strategies. This article will initially discuss each transdermal enhancement method used in the development of first-generation transdermal products. These methods include drug/vehicle interactions, vesicles and particles, stratum corneum modification, energy-driven methods and stratum corneum bypassing techniques. Through suitable design and implementation of active stratum corneum bypassing methods, notably microneedle technology, transdermal delivery systems have been shown to deliver both low and high molecular weight drugs. Microneedle technology platforms have proven themselves to be more versatile than other transdermal systems with opportunities for intradermal delivery of drugs/biotherapeutics and therapeutic drug monitoring. These have shown that microneedles have been a prospective strategy for improving transdermal delivery systems. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].}

      \field{abstract}{Nanodiscs are soluble nanoscale phospholipid bilayers which can self-assemble integral membrane proteins for biophysical, enzymatic or structural investigations. This means for rendering membrane proteins soluble at the single molecule level offers advantages over liposomes or detergent micelles in terms of size, stability, ability to add genetically modifiable features to the Nanodisc structure and ready access to both sides of the phospholipid bilayer domain. Thus the Nanodisc system provides a novel platform for understanding membrane protein function. We provide an overview of the Nanodisc approach and document through several examples many of the applications to the study of the structure and function of integral membrane proteins. © 2009 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.}

      \field{abstract}{We have used nanoscale field effect transistor devices with carbon nanotubes as the conducting channel to detect protein binding. A PEI/PEG polymer coating layer has been employed to avoid nonspecific binding, with attachment of biotin to the layer for specific molecular recognition. Biotin-streptavidin binding has been detected by changes in the device characteristic. Nonspecific binding was observed in devices without the polymer coating, while no binding was found for polymer-coated but not biotinylated devices. Streptavidin, in which the biotin-binding sites were blocked by reaction with excess biotin, produced essentially no change in device characteristic of the biotinylated polymer-coated devices.}

      \field{abstract}{Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been proposed and actively explored as multipurpose innovative nanoscaffolds for applications in fields such as material science, drug delivery and diagnostic applications. Their versatile physicochemical features are nonetheless limited by their scarce solubilization in both aqueous and organic solvents. In order to overcome this drawback CNTs can be easily non-covalently functionalized with different dispersants. In the present review we focus on the peculiar hydrophobic character of pristine CNTs that prevent them to easily disperse in organic solvents. We report some interesting examples of CNTs dispersants with the aim to highlight the essential features a molecule should possess in order to act as a good carbon nanotube dispersant both in water and in organic solvents. The review pinpoints also a few examples of dispersant design. The last section is devoted to the exploitation of the major quality of non-covalent functionalization that is its reversibility and the possibility to obtain stimuliresponsive precipitation or dispersion of CNTs.}

      \field{abstract}{We have developed a novel, all-electronic biosensor for opioids that consists of an engineered μ-opioid receptor protein, with high binding affinity for opioids, chemically bonded to a graphene field-effect transistor to read out ligand binding. A variant of the receptor protein that provided chemical recognition was computationally redesigned to enhance its solubility and stability in an aqueous environment. A shadow mask process was developed to fabricate arrays of hundreds of graphene transistors with average mobility of ∼1500 cm2 V-1 s-1 and yield exceeding 98\%. The biosensor exhibits high sensitivity and selectivity for the target naltrexone, an opioid receptor antagonist, with a detection limit of 10 pg/mL. © 2014 American Chemical Society.}

      \field{abstract}{Aromatic molecules such as pyrenes are a unique class of building units for graphene functionalization, forming highly ordered π−π stacks while peptides provide more complex, biocompatible linkers. Understanding the adsorption and stacking behavior of these molecules and their influence on material properties is an essential step in enabling highly repeatable 2D material-based applications, such as biosensors, gas sensors, and solar cells. In this work, we characterize pyrene and peptide self-assembly on graphene substrates using fluorescence microscopy, atomic force microscopy and electrolyte-gated field-effect measurements supported by quantum mechanical calculations. We find distinct binding and assembly modes for pyrenes versus peptides with corresponding distinct electronic signatures in their characteristic charge neutrality point and field-effect slope responses. Our data demonstrates that pyrene- and peptide-based self-assembly platforms can be highly beneficial for precisely customizing graphene electronic properties for desired device technologies such as transport-based biosensing graphene field-effect transistors.}

      \field{abstract}{Portable nanosensor systems for the rapid detection of specific odorants are crucial for anti-bioterrorism, disease diagnostics, and food safety. Since the first report of an 'electronic nose', there have been many efforts to develop artificial olfactory sensors based on arrays of semiconductor devices. [1,2] However, the capability of the electronic nose is still, in many ways, inferior to that of the human olfactory system in terms of selectivity. In the smelling process of the human olfactory system, the initial step is the binding of specific odorants to the olfactory receptor proteins, which triggers signal transduction in a cell. [3-5] The last decade has been marked by the development of a 'bioelectronic nose' with the olfactory receptor proteins as a sensing part. [6] Various techniques, such as quartz-crystal microbalance, electrochemical impedance spectrometry, surface plasmon resonance, and light-addressable potentiometric sensors, have been used as transducer parts of the bioelectronic nose, while those techniques often suffer from bulky system size and limited sensitivity. [6-10] On the other hand, although nanometer-scale sensors based on single-walled carbon nanotube (swCNT)-field effect transistors (FETs) have been utilized for highly-sensitive chemical sensing, the low selectivity of such sensors has been a major problem holding back their practical applications. [11-16] Herein, we report the detection of odorant molecules with single-carbon-atomic resolution using a 'bioelectronic nose' based on human olfactory receptor-functionalized swCNT-FETs. In this device, lipid membranes that contain human olfactory receptor 2AG1 (hOR2AG1) were coated on swCNT-FET surfaces and the deformation of the hOR2AG1 protein upon binding specific odorant molecules was detected by the swCNT-FET. We demonstrate the detection of specific odorant molecules with single-carbon-atomic resolution and femtomolar sensitivity in real time. Furthermore, this is the first demonstration of monitoring the operation of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) in a cell membrane with swCNT-FET sensors, and it should open various new applications in drug and fragrance development, because the olfactory receptor proteins [4] are the largest family of GPCR, which is the most ubiquitous class of drug targets: up to 50\% of current drugs are targeted at GPCR. [5] Figure 1 shows the basic steps to prepare our bioelectric nose. The fabrication steps of swCNT-FETs were similar to those reported previously. [17] Briefly, an octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) self-assembled monolayer (SAM) with nonpolar terminal groups was patterned on a SiO 2 surface using photolithography. When the substrate was placed in the solution of swCNTs (usually 0.1 mg mL À1 in 1,2-dichlorobenzene), a single layer of swCNTs was selectively adsorbed onto bare SiO 2 regions. Afterwards, electrodes (30 nm Au on 10 nm Pd) were fabricated using conventional photolithography. Human olfactory receptor 2AG1 (hOR2AG1) protein was expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) as a fusion protein with a glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-tag at its N-terminus (Fig. 2). Cells were sonicated to obtain a membrane fraction. To remove membrane-integrated proteins other than hOR2AG1, the membrane fraction was treated with 2\% Triton X-100 and then collected by centrifugation. To immobilize the olfactory receptor (hOR2AG1), 1 mL of the collected fraction was evenly spread onto the swCNT-FET, and it was vacuum-dried for 4 h. COMMUNICATION www.advmat.de Figure 1.

      \field{abstract}{We developed an olfactory-nanovesicle-fused carbon-nanotube-transistor biosensor (OCB) that mimics the responses of a canine nose for the sensitive and selective detection of hexanal, an indicator of the oxidation of food. OCBs allowed us to detect hexanal down to 1 fM concentration in real-time. Significantly, we demonstrated the detection of hexanal with an excellent selectivity capable of discriminating hexanal from analogous compounds such as pentanal, heptanal, and octanal. Furthermore, we successfully detected hexanal in spoiled milk without any pretreatment processes. Considering these results, our sensor platform should offer a new method for the assessment of food quality and contribute to the development of portable sensing devices.}

      \field{abstract}{A bioelectronic nose for the real-time assessment of water quality was constructed with human olfactory receptor (hOR) and single-walled carbon nanotube field-effect transistor (swCNT-FET). Geosmin (GSM) and 2-methylisoborneol (MIB), mainly produced by bacteria, are representative odor compounds and also indicators of contamination in the water supply system. For the screening of hORs which respond to these compounds, we performed CRE-luciferase assays of the two odorants in heterologous cell system. Human OR51S1 for GSM and OR3A4 for MIB were selected, and nanovesicles expressing the hORs on surface were produced from HEK-293 cell. Carbon nanotube field-effect transistor was functionalized with the nanovesicles. The bioelectronic nose was able to selectively detect GSM and MIB at concentrations as low as a 10ngL-1. Furthermore, detection of these compounds from the real samples such as tap water, bottled water and river water was available without any pretreatment processes.}

      \field{abstract}{We report a strategy for the human-like smelling of a rose scent utilizing olfactory receptor nanodisc (ND)-based bioelectronic nose devices. In this strategy, a floating electrode (FE)-based carbon nanotube (CNT) field effect transistor (FET) was functionalized with human olfactory receptor 1A2 (hOR1A2)-embedded NDs (hOR1A2NDs). The hOR1A2NDs responded to rose scent molecules specifically, which were monitored electrically using the underlying CNT-FET. This strategy allowed us to quantitatively assess the contents of geraniol and citronellol, the main components of a rose scent, as low as 1 fM and 10 fM, respectively. In addition, it enabled us to selectively discriminate a specific rose odorant from other odorants. Significantly, we also demonstrated that the responses of hOR1A2NDs to a rose scent could be strongly enhanced by enhancer materials like a human nose. Furthermore, the method provided a means to quantitatively evaluate rose scent components in real samples such as rose oil. Since our method allows one to quantitatively evaluate general rose scent ingredients just like a human nose, it could be a powerful strategy for versatile basic research and various applications such as fragrance development.}

      \field{abstract}{Abstract Long-haul travel does not constitute an obstacle for tourists to travel and is fast gaining the attention of tourists in new and unique experiences. This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking’ were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history’. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances. Keywords:}

      \field{abstract}{Although insects have proven to be valuable models for exploring the function, organization, and development of the olfactory system, the receptor molecules that bind odors have not been identified in any insect. We have developed a novel search algorithm, used it to search the Drosophila genomic sequence database, and identified a large multigene family encoding seven transmembrane domain proteins that are expressed in olfactory organs. We show that expression is restricted to subsets of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) for a number of these genes. Different members of the family initiate expression at different times during antennal development. Some of the genes are not expressed in a mutant of the Acj6 POU-domain transcription factor, a mutant in which a subset of ORNs show abnormal odorant specificities.}

      \field{abstract}{Detection of chemical signals from the environment through olfaction is an indispensable mechanism for maintaining an insect's life, evoking critical behavioral responses. Among several proteins involved in the olfactory perception process, the odorant binding protein (OBP) has been shown to be essential for a normally functioning olfactory system. This paper discusses the role of OBPs in insect chemoreception. Here, structural aspects, mechanisms of action and binding affinity of such proteins are reviewed, as well as their promising application as molecular targets for the development of new strategies for insect population management and other technological purposes.}

      \field{abstract}{The olfactory system must recognize and discriminate amongst an enormous variety of chemicals in the environment. To contend with such diversity, insects have evolved a family of odorant-gated ion channels comprised of a highly conserved co-receptor (Orco) and a divergent odorant receptor (OR) that confers chemical specificity. Here, we present the single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structure of an Orco homomer from the parasitic fig wasp Apocrypta bakeri at 3.5 Å resolution, providing structural insight into this receptor family. Orco possesses a novel channel architecture, with four subunits symmetrically arranged around a central pore that diverges into four lateral conduits that open to the cytosol. The Orco tetramer has few inter-subunit interactions within the membrane and is bound together by a small cytoplasmic anchor domain. The minimal sequence conservation among ORs maps largely to the pore and anchor domain, shedding light on how the architecture of this receptor family accommodates its remarkable sequence diversity and facilitates the evolution of odour tuning.}

      \field{abstract}{In insects, each olfactory sensory neuron expresses between one and three ligand-binding members of the olfactory receptor (OR) gene family, along with the highly conserved and broadly expressed Or83b co-receptor. The functional insect OR consists of a heteromeric complex of unknown stoichiometry but comprising at least one variable odorant-binding subunit and one constant Or83b family subunit. Insect ORs lack homology to G-protein-coupled chemosensory receptors in vertebrates and possess a distinct seven-transmembrane topology with the amino terminus located intracellularly. Here we provide evidence that heteromeric insect ORs comprise a new class of ligand-activated non-selective cation channels. Heterologous cells expressing silkmoth, fruitfly or mosquito heteromeric OR complexes showed extracellular Ca2+ influx and cation-non-selective ion conductance on stimulation with odorant. Odour-evoked OR currents are independent of known G-protein-coupled second messenger pathways. The fast response kinetics and OR-subunit-dependent K+ ion selectivity of the insect OR complex support the hypothesis that the complex between OR and Or83b itself confers channel activity. Direct evidence for odorant-gated channels was obtained by outside-out patch-clamp recording of Xenopus oocyte and HEK293T cell membranes expressing insect OR complexes. The ligand-gated ion channel formed by an insect OR complex seems to be the basis for a unique strategy that insects have acquired to respond to the olfactory environment. ©2008 Nature Publishing Group.}

      \field{abstract}{We have used transistor devices with carbon nanotubes as the conducting channel to explore the interaction between the nanotube surface and streptavidin, both in dry and in buffer environments. We find charge transfer between the protein and the nanotubes in both cases. Comparison with simpler molecules allows the estimation of the transferred charge. We argue that this effect can be understood as being due to the interaction between the -NH 2 groups of the protein and the aromatic surface.}

      \field{abstract}{Non-specific adsorption (NSA) is a persistent problem that negatively affects biosensors, decreasing sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility. Passive and active removal methods exist to remedy this issue, by coating the surface or generating surface forces to shear away weakly adhered biomolecules, respectively. However, many surface coatings are not compatible or effective for sensing, and thus active removal methods have been developed to combat this phenomenon. This review aims to provide an overview of methods of NSA reduction in biosensing, focusing on the shift from passive methods to active methods in the past decade. Attention is focused on protein NSA, due to their common use in biosensing for biomarker diagnostics. To our knowledge, this is the first review to comprehensively discuss active NSA removal methods. Lastly, the challenges and future perspectives of NSA reduction in biosensing are discussed.}

      \field{abstract}{It has been reported that protein adsorption on single-walled carbon nanotube field effect transistors (FETs) leads to appreciable changes in the electrical conductance of the devices, a phenomenon that can be exploited for label-free detection of biomolecules with a high potential for miniaturization. This work presents an elucidation of the electronic biosensing mechanisms with a newly developed microarray of nanotube "micromat" sensors. Chemical functionalization schemes are devised to block selected components of the devices from protein adsorption, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of methoxy(poly-(ethylene glycol))thiol (mPEG-SH) on the metal electrodes (Au, Pd) and PEG-containing surfactants on the nanotubes. Extensive characterization reveals that electronic effects occurring at the metal-nanotube contacts due to protein adsorption constitute a more significant contribution to the electronic biosensing signal than adsorption solely along the exposed lengths of the nanotubes.}

      \field{abstract}{The paper reports carbon nanotube (CNT)-based immunosensors for the detection of two types of microorganisms, bacteria and viruses. The pathogen Escherichia coli O157:H7 and the bacteriophage T7 were selected as model for bacteria and viruses, respectively, while E. coli K12 and the bacteriophage MS2 were used to assess the selectivity of the biosensor. The transduction element consisted of single-walled carbon nanotubes aligned in parallel bridging two gold electrodes to function as a chemiresistive biosensor. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) were functionalized with specific antibodies (Ab) for the different microorganisms by covalent immobilization to the non-covalently bound 1-pyrene butanoic acid succinimidyl ester. A significant increase in the resistance of the device was observed when the biosensor was exposed to E. coli O157:H7 whole cells or lysates with a limit of detection of 105 and 103CFU (colony forming units)/mL, corresponding to 103 and 101CFU/chip, respectively, while no response was observed when the biosensor was exposed to the E. coli K12. In the case of virus detection, a significant resistance increase was detected due to interaction of the bacteriophages with the Abs, with a limit of detection of 103PFU/mL corresponding to 101PFU/chip and excellent selectivity against MS2 bacteriophage. The sensor exhibited a fast response time of ∼5min in the case of bacteriophage detection, while the response time for the detection of bacteria was 60min. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.}

      \field{abstract}{Carbon nanotube transistors show tremendous potential for electronic detection of biomolecules in solution. However, the nature and magnitude of the sensing signal upon molecular adsorption have so far remained controversial. Here, the authors show that the choice of the reference electrode is critical and resolves much of the previous controversy. The authors eliminate artifacts related to the reference electrode by using a well-defined reference electrode to accurately control the solution potential. Upon addition of bovine serum albumin proteins, the authors measure a transistor threshold shift of -15 mV which can be unambiguously attributed to the adsorption of biomolecules in the vicinity of the nanotube. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.}

      \field{abstract}{SU-8 is an epoxy-based, negative-tone photoresist that has been extensively utilized to fabricate myriads of devices including biomedical devices in the recent years. This paper first reviews the biocompatibility of SU-8 for in vitro and in vivo applications. Surface modification techniques as well as various biomedical applications based on SU-8 are also discussed. Although SU-8 might not be completely biocompatible, existing surface modification techniques, such as O2 plasma treatment or grafting of biocompatible polymers, might be sufficient to minimize biofouling caused by SU-8. As a result, a great deal of effort has been directed to the development of SU-8-based functional devices for biomedical applications. This review includes biomedical applications such as platforms for cell culture and cell encapsulation, immunosensing, neural probes, and implantable pressure sensors. Proper treatments of SU-8 and slight modification of surfaces have enabled the SU-8 as one of the unique choices of materials in the fabrication of biomedical devices. Due to the versatility of SU-8 and comparative advantages in terms of improved Young’s modulus and yield strength, we believe that SU-8-based biomedical devices would gain wider proliferation among the biomedical community in the future.}

      \field{abstract}{For the integration of advance gate stacks, selective wet etching of an Al 2 O 3 capping layer on top of high-k dielectrics was studied. From the fundamental etch study on the single-layer Al 2 O 3 , HfSiO and HfSiON thin films were prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD). Using the etch rate information of each single layer, several optimized etch conditions in acidic and basic etchants including H 3 PO 4 , NH 4 OH, and TMAH resulted in wet etch selectivities of Al 2 O 3 to high-k materials higher than 50:1. As a result, the Al 2 O 3 capping layer on Si/SiO 2 /high-k multi-layer gate stack could be completely removed without thinning of the underlying high-k thin films. Finally, the etch mechanisms of Al 2 O 3 in acidic and basic etchants were studied and the etch rates of Al 2 O 3 were determined as functions of [H + ] and [OH − ].}

      \field{abstract}{Graphene-based point-of-care (PoC) and chemical sensors can be fabricated using pho-tolithographic processes at wafer-scale. However, these approaches are known to leave polymer residues on the graphene surface, which are difficult to remove completely. In addition, graphene growth and transfer processes can introduce defects into the graphene layer. Both defects and resist contamination can affect the homogeneity of graphene-based PoC sensors, leading to inconsistent device performance and unreliable sensing. Sensor reliability is also affected by the harsh chemical environments used for chemical functionalisation of graphene PoC sensors, which can degrade parts of the sensor device. Therefore, a reliable, wafer-scale method of passivation, which isolates the graphene from the rest of the device, protecting the less robust device features from any aggres-sive chemicals, must be devised. This work covers the application of molecular vapour deposition technology to create a dielectric passivation film that protects graphene-based biosensing devices from harsh chemicals. We utilise a previously reported “healing effect” of Al2 O3 on graphene to reduce photoresist residue from the graphene surface and reduce the prevalence of graphene defects to improve graphene device homogeneity. The improvement in device consistency allows for more reliable, homogeneous graphene devices, that can be fabricated at wafer-scale for sensing and biosensing applications.}

      \field{abstract}{This paper explores the possibility of using arrays of metallic carbon nanotubes as sensors. Unlike their semiconducting counterparts, single-walled carbon nanotube arrays or networks that are dominated by metallic conduction pathways have not been investigated for their environmental sensitivity. In this work, we demonstrate transduction of molecular adsorption via charge transfer through predominantly metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes. Raman spectroscopy and electric field dependent transport confirm that signal transduction takes place through primarily large diameter metallic nanotubes. This unique signal transduction mechanism might have implications for novel sensors. The scaling of the signal with array impedance is well described using an irreversible binding model developed previously. The arrays have several advantages including a simple, two-electrode fabrication, rapid regeneration, and a responsivity that scales predictably and linearly with the number of adsorption sites. An array-assisted hydrolysis of reactive analytes is found to regenerate the nanotube surface from hydrolyzable species which include important organophosphate nerve agents. © 2006 American Chemical Society.}

      \field{abstract}{Leakage currents and dielectric breakdown were studied in MIS capacitors of metal-aluminum oxide-silicon. The aluminum oxide was produced by thermally oxidizing AlN at 800-1100 C under dry O 2 conditions. The AlN films were deposited by RF magnetron sputtering on p-type Si (100) sub-strates. Thermal oxidation produced Al 2 O 3 with a thickness and structure that depended on the process time and temperature. The MIS capacitors exhibited the charge regimes of accumulation, depletion, and inversion on the Si semiconductor surface. The best electrical properties were obtained when all of the AlN was fully oxidized to Al 2 O 3 with no residual AlN. The MIS flatband voltage was near 0 V, the net oxide trapped charge density, ox , was less than 10 11 cm 2 , and the interface trap density, , was less than 10 11 cm 2 eV 1. At an oxide electric field of 0.3 MV/cm, the leakage current density was less than 10 7 A cm 2 , with a resistivity greater than 10 12-cm. The critical field for dielectric breakdown ranged from 4 to 5 MV/cm. The temperature dependence of the current versus electric field indicated that the conduction mechanism was Frenkel-Poole emission, which has the interesting property that higher temperatures reduce the current. This may be important for the reliability of circuits operating under extreme conditions. The dielectric constant ranged from 3 to 9. The excellent electronic quality of aluminum oxide may be attractive for field effect transistor applications.}

      \field{abstract}{We have investigated a wide variety of surfactants for their efficiency in dissolving isolated single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) in water. In doing so, we have completely avoided the harsh chemical or mechanical conditions, such as acid or ultrasonic treatments, that are known to damage SWNTs. Bile salts in particular are found to be exceptionally effective in dissolving individual tubes, as evidenced by highly resolved optical absorption spectra, bright bandgap fluorescence, and the unprecedented resolution (~ 2.5 cm -1) of the radial breathing modes in Raman spectra. Tnis is attributed to the formation of very regular and stable micelles around the nanotubes providing an unusually homogeneous environment. Quantitative information concerning the degree of solubilization is obtained from absorption spectroscopy.}

      \field{abstract}{This chapter aims to present recent examples of supramolecular\nfunctionalization of carbon nanotubes. The non-covalent\nfunctionalization appears as a solution for the future applications in\nnanotechnologies since it allows the functionalization and manipulation\nof nanotubes without the introduction of sp(3) defects in the\npi-conjugated system. Thus, the optical and electronic properties of the\nnanotubes remain preserved. In the first part of this chapter, we\npresent the use of surfactant for the dispersion of nanotubes and its\napplication for sorting. Then we report several examples of\nfunctionalization of nanotubes based on pi-stacking interactions with\npyrene derivatives. Finally, in the last part we review the wrapping of\nphoto/electroactive polymers around the nanotube sidewalls. We put a\nparticular focus on polyflurorene-based polymers and we show their\nutilization for the separation of nanotubes in diameter and chirality.}

      \field{abstract}{Several allotropes of carbon are increasingly used as functional scaffolds to prepare bioconjugate complexes in the construction of detection or delivery agents or to make novel nano-electrical devices in material science or biosensor applications. Spherical fullerenes (Buckyballs), carbon nanotubes, and single graphene sheets can be chemically modified to provide functional groups or reactive groups for further attachment of biomolecules or other ligands. The unique unsaturated nature of these scaffolds requires peculiar modification reactions to permit conjugation while not affecting their electrically conductive or spectral characteristics, including their potential use in biosensor circuits and as photosensitizers or fluorescent tags. This chapter reviews the various types and properties of these carbon allotropes and provides protocols for successful modification or conjugation using a number of reagents and reaction strategies.}

      \field{abstract}{We investigated the effects of surfactants on the morphologies and electronic transport properties of solution-processed thin films of semiconductor-enriched single-wall carbon nanotubes. The network morphologies were observed using atomic force microscopy, and the electronic transport properties of thin-film transistors composed of these materials were examined. The network morphologies were highly dependent on the surfactants, although the thin films were fabricated from the same nanotube using the same process. Among the four surfactants examined in this work, sodium deoxycholate produced the finest mesh structures that comprised mostly individual nanotubes. The performance of the thin-film transistor was highly correlated with the morphology of the nanotube network; however, no considerable effect of the residual surfactant was observed. Because of the fine mesh structure, both the highest on/off ratio (1 × 106) and the highest mobility (42 cm2 V-1 s-1) were obtained for the thin-film transistor produced from sodium deoxycholate. © 2013 American Chemical Society.}

      \field{abstract}{Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are proving to be versatile nanomaterials that exhibit superior and attractive electrical, optical, chemical, physical, and mechanical properties. Different kinds of CNTs exist, and their associated properties have been actively explored and widely exploited from fundamental studies to practical applications. Obtaining high-quality CNTs in large volumes is desirable, especially for scalable electronic, photonic, chemical, and mechanical systems. At present, abundant but random CNTs are synthesized by various growth methods including arc discharge, chemical vapor deposition, and molecular beam epitaxy. An economical way to secure pristine CNTs is to disperse the raw soot of CNTs in solutions, from which purified CNTs are collected via sorting methods. Individual CNTs are generally hydrophobic, not readily soluble, requiring an agent, known as a surfactant to facilitate effective dispersions. Furthermore, the combination of surfactants, polymers, DNA, and other additives can enhance the purity of specific types of CNTs in confidence dispersions. With highly-pure CNTs, designated functional devices are built to demonstrate improved performance. This review surveys and highlights the essential roles and significant impacts of surfactants in dispersing and sorting CNTs.}

      \field{abstract}{To find use in electronics, single-walled carbon nanotubes need to be efficiently separated by electronic type and aligned to ensure optimal and reproducible electronic properties. We report the fabrication of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) network field-effect transistors, deposited from solution, possessing controllable topology and an on/off ratio as high as 900,000. The spin-assisted alignment and density of the SWNTs are tuned by different surfaces that effectively vary the degree of interaction with surface functionalities in the device channel. This leads to a self-sorted SWNT network in which nanotube chirality separation and simultaneous control of density and alignment occur in one step during device fabrication. Micro-Raman experiments corroborate device results as a function of surface chemistry, indicating enrichment of the specific SWNT electronic type absorbed onto the modified dielectric.}

      \field{abstract}{Notable progress has been made on the synthesis, properties and uses of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in the past two decades. However, the controlled growth of single-wall CNTs (SWCNTs) with predefined and uniform structures remains a big challenge, and making full use of CNTs in applications still requires great effort. In this article, our strategies and recent progress on the controlled synthesis of SWCNTs by chemical vapor deposition are reviewed, and the applications of CNTs in lithium-ion batteries, transparent conductive films, and as connectors of metal atomic chains are discussed. Finally, future prospects for CNTs are considered.}

      \field{abstract}{In this work, we identify two issues that can significantly affect the accuracy of AFM measurements of the diameter of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and propose a protocol that reduces errors associated with these issues. Measurements of the nanotube height under different applied forces demonstrate that even moderate forces significantly compress several different types of SWCNTs, leading to errors in measured diameters that must be minimized and/or corrected. Substrate and nanotube roughness also make major contributions to the uncertainty associated with the extraction of diameters from measured images. An analysis method has been developed that reduces the uncertainties associated with this extraction to <0.1 nm. This method is then applied to measure the diameter distribution of individual highly semiconducting enriched nanotubes in networks prepared from polyfluorene/SWCNT dispersions. Good agreement is obtained between diameter distributions for the same sample measured with two different commercial AFM instruments, indicating the reproducibility of the method. The reduced uncertainty in diameter measurements based on this method facilitates: (1) determination of the thickness of the polymer layer wrapping the nanotubes and (2) measurement of nanotube compression at tube–tube junctions within the network.}

      \field{abstract}{Interest in the skew-normal and related families of distributions has grown enormously over recent years, as theory has advanced, challenges of data have grown, and computational tools have made substantial progress. This comprehensive treatment, blending theory and practice, will be the standard resource for statisticians and applied researchers. Assuming only basic knowledge of (non-measure-theoretic) probability and statistical inference, the book is accessible to the wide range of researchers who use statistical modelling techniques. Guiding readers through the main concepts and results, it covers both the probability and the statistics sides of the subject, in the univariate and multivariate settings. The theoretical development is complemented by numerous illustrations and applications to a range of fields including quantitative finance, medical statistics, environmental risk studies, and industrial and business efficiency. The author’s freely available R package sn, available from CRAN, equips readers to put the methods into action with their own data.}

      \field{abstract}{Wereport on the damage caused to mechanically exfoliated monolayer graphene, bound to silicon dioxide substrate, upon contact with liquids. This phenomenon is of significant importance for a wide range of applications where monolayer graphene sheets are used with liquids, especially as an electrode material in electrochemical applications such as energy storage and conversion. Liquid-induced damage to SiO2-bound graphene was previously observed with a range of solvents. A recently developed microdroplet system, used for a detailed examination of this behaviour, reveals that fewlayer graphene flakes down to a bi-layer are stable with respect to aqueous electrolyte droplet formation, but the stability of these droplets is significantly reduced on monolayer graphene and irreversible rupture of the underlying graphene flake occurs. This damage, which we attribute to the presence of nanoscale defects and high adhesion between the graphene and the substrate, seems specific to plasma-cleaned SiO2 substrates and is not observed on flakes transferred to other substrates. Furthermore, the introduction of impurities, in the form of both polymer residues and native impurities between the flake and the SiO2 substrate, significantly enhance graphene's immunity to external strain as shown by optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy.}

      \field{abstract}{As-synthesized, semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are nominally charge neutral. However, ionic surfactants that are commonly used to disperse SWCNTs in solution can lead to significantly charged aggregates adsorbed to the nanotube. Here, electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) was used to characterize the static-charge interactions between individual SWCNTs and the local environment. We report nonuniform spatial charge distributions with highly varying magnitudes ranging between ±15 e associated with surfactant coverage on long SWCNTs (>1.5 μm). EFM images acquired after resonant photoexcitation demonstrate charge carrier localization due to electrostatic interactions with charged surfactant aggregates. Charge densities as measured by EFM are used to estimate the depth of this electrostatically induced potential well, calculated to be on the order of hundreds of millielectronvolts, suggesting that surfactant charges heterogeneously covering SWCNTs provide traps for excitons potentially leading to their localization.}

      \field{abstract}{Nonnormal data arise often in practice, prompting the development of flexible distributions for modeling such situations. In this article, we describe two multivariate distributions, the skew-normal and the skew-t, which can be used to model skewed and heavy-tailed continuous data. We then discuss some inferential issues that can arise when fitting these distributions to real data. We also consider the use of these distributions in a regression setting for more flexible parametric modeling of the conditional distribution given other predictors. We present commands for fitting univariate and multivariate skew-normal and skew-t regressions in Stata (skewnreg, skewtreg, mskewnreg, and mskewtreg) as well as some postestimation features (predict and skewrplot). We also demonstrate the use of the commands for the analysis of the famous Australian Institute of Sport data and U.S. precipitation data.}

      \field{abstract}{Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have great potential for use in electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, methods for synthesizing SWCNTs produce a mixture of metallic and semiconducting materials, which require additional processing to separate by electronic type. Purification and enrichment of the semiconducting fraction is readily achieved by using the centrifugation of aqueous suspensions of SWCNTs with the help of surfactants, but this leaves residual surfactant on the SWCNT surface that can impact their electronic and optical properties. Here, we present a detailed study of the sodium taurodeoxycholate (STDC) surfactant removal process during vacuum annealing, showing that it occurs through fragmentation of the surfactant, and that complete removal requires exceedingly high temperatures, which indicates strong binding to the SWCNTs. We then present an approach based on air oxidation and mild annealing to completely remove the surfactant while maintaining the SWCNT properties. Using this approach, we compare single SWCNT electronic devices with and without STDC and show that, despite the very strong surfactant binding, it does not affect device performance substantially. © 2014 American Chemical Society.}

      \field{abstract}{Two-point probe and Raman spectroscopy have been used to investigate the effects of vacuum annealing and argon bombardment on the conduction characteristics of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Surface contamination has a large effect on the two-point probe conductivity measurements which results in inconsistent and nonreproducible contacts. The electric field under the contacts is enhanced which results in overlapping depletion regions when probe separations are small (<4 μm) causing very high resistances. Annealing at 200 and 500 °C reduced the surface contamination on the MWCNT, but high resistance contacts still did not allow intrinsic conductivity measurements of the MWCNT. The high resistance measured due to the overlapping depletion regions was not observed after annealing to 500 °C. Argon bombardment reduced the surface contamination more than vacuum annealing at 500 °C but caused a slight increase in the defects concentration, enabling the resistivity of the MWCNT to be calculated, which is found to be dependent on the CNT diameter. The observations have significant implications for future CNT-based devices.}

The various types of Raman scattering processes relevant to carbon nanotubes are reviewed, and the theoretical foundations for these topics are presented. The most common experimental techniques used to probe carbon nanotubes are summarized, followed by a review of the novel experimental findings for each of the features in the first order and second order Raman spectra for single wall carbon nanotubes. These results are presented and discussed in connection with theoretical considerations. Raman spectra for bundles of SWNTs, for SWNTs surrounded by various common wrapping agents, and for isolated SWNTs at the single nanotube level are reviewed.

      \field{abstract}{In this paper, we report ultra-thin liquid crystal films of semiconducting carbon nanotubes using a simple vacuum filtration process. Vacuum filtration of nanotubes in aqueous surfactant solution formed nematic domains on the filter membrane surface and exhibited local ordering. A 2D fast Fourier transform was used to calculate the order parameters from scanning electron microscopy images. The order parameter was observed to be sensitive to the filtration time demonstrating different regions of transformation namely nucleation of nematic domains, nanotube accumulation and large domain growth.Transmittance versus sheet resistance measurements of such films resulted in optical to dc conductivity of σ opt/σ dc = 9.01 indicative of purely semiconducting nanotube liquid crystal network.Thin films of nanotube liquid crystals with order parameters ranging from S = 0.1-0.5 were patterned into conducting channels of transistor devices which showed high I on/I off ratios from 10-19 800 and electron mobility values μ e = 0.3-78.8 cm2 (V-s)-1, hole mobility values μ h = 0.4-287 cm2 (V-s)-1. High I on/I off ratios were observed at low order parameters and film mass. A Schottky barrier transistor model is consistent with the observed transistor characteristics. Electron and hole mobilities were seen to increase with order parameters and carbon nanotube mass fractions. A fundamental tradeoff between decreasing on/off ratio and increasing mobility with increasing nanotube film mass and order parameter is therefore concluded. Increase in order parameters of nanotubes liquid crystals improved the electronic transport properties as witnessed by the increase in σ dc/σ opt values on macroscopic films and high mobilities in microscopic transistors. Liquid crystal networks of semiconducting nanotubes as demonstrated here are simple to fabricate, transparent, scalable and could find wide ranging device applications. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.}

      \field{abstract}{We report a systematic theoretical and experimental investigation on the electronic transport evolution in metallic and semiconducting carbon nanotubes thin films enriched by gold nanocrystals. We used an ultra-clean production method of both types of single-walled carbon nanotube thin films with/without gold nanocrystals, which were uniformly dispersed in the whole volume of the thin films, causing a modification of the doping level of the films (verified by Raman spectroscopy). We propose a modification of the electronic transport model with the additional high-temperature features that allow us to interpret the transport within a broader temperature range and that are related to the conductivity type of carbon nanotubes. Moreover, we demonstrate, that the proposed model is also working for thin films with the addition of gold nanocrystals, and only a change of the conductivity level of our samples is observed caused by modification of potential barriers between carbon nanotubes. We also find unusual behavior of doped metallic carbon nanotube thin film, which lowers its conductivity due to doping.}

      \field{abstract}{By combining atomic force microscopy and trans-port measurements, we systematically investigated effects of thermal annealing on surface morphologies and electrical properties of single-layer graphene devices fabricated by electron beam lithography on silicon oxide (SiO2) substrates. Thermal treatment above 300 °C in vacuum was required to effectively remove resist residues on graphene surfaces. However, annealing at high temperature was found to concomitantly bring graphene in close contact with SiO2 substrates and induce increased coupling between them, which leads to heavy hole doping and severe degradation of mobilities in graphene devices. To address this problem, a wet-chemical approach employing chloroform was developed in our study, which was shown to enable both intrinsic surfaces and enhanced electrical properties of graphene devices. Upon the recovery of intrinsic surfaces of graphene, the adsorption and assisted fibrillation of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ1-42) on graphene were electrically measured in real time. © 2011 American Chemical Society.}

      \field{abstract}{The intrinsic properties of initially p-type doped graphene (grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD)) can be recovered by buffered oxide etch (BOE) treatment, and the dominant factor governing p-type doping is identified as the H 2O/O 2 redox system. Semi-ionic C-F bonding prevents the reaction between the products of the H 2O/O 2 redox system and graphene. BOE-treated graphene field effect transistors (FETs) subsequently exposed to air, became p-type doped due to recovery of the H 2O/O 2 redox system. In comparison, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)-coated graphene FETs had improved stability for maintaining the intrinsic graphene electronic properties. © 2012 American Chemical Society.}

      \field{abstract}{We have studied gate hysteresis of carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNFETs) on silicon oxide substrates in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) at low temperatures. It is found that the hysteresis is neither reduced by thermal annealing at temperatures over 300°C under UHV nor significantly affected by independent adsorption of ammonia or water at T = 56 K. However, the hysteresis decreases greatly upon coadsorption of water and ammonia below condensation temperatures and restores completely with desorption of the adsorbed water layer. On the basis of these results, it is concluded that the main cause of gate hysteresis in CNFETs on silicon oxide substrate is charge transfer between the carbon nanotube and charge traps at the silicon oxide/ ambient interface. We propose a mechanism for gate hysteresis that involves surface silanol groups as the major sources of screening charges. This surface silanol model is supported by results from scanning surface potential microscopy (SSPM). © 2007 American Chemical Society.}

      \field{abstract}{We report hysteresis-free carbon nanotube thin-film transistors (CNT-TFTs) employing a fluorocarbon polymer (Teflon-AF) as an encapsulation layer. Such fluorocarbon encapsulation improves device uniformity with excellent operation stability in air and even in water. The fluoropolymers possess high hydrophobicity for efficient removal of water molecules from the vicinity of nanotubes, which are known to induce charge trapping. In addition, the strong dipole associated with the carbon-fluorine bonds can provide effective screening of the charge carriers in nanotubes from various trap states in the substrate. We also report on the extended applications of encapsulation with Teflon-AF for the realization of dual-gate CNT-TFTs, where one gate is used to control the threshold voltage and the other to switch the device. The fluorocarbon encapsulation technique presents a promising approach for enhanced device reliability, which is critical for future system-level electronics based on CNTs. © 2014 American Chemical Society.}

      \field{abstract}{The large amount of hysteresis and threshold voltage variation in carbon nanotube transistors impedes their use in highly integrated digital applications. The origin of this variability is elucidated by employing a top-coated, hydrophobic monolayer to passivate bottom-gated devices. Compared to passivating only the supporting substrate, it is found that covering the nanotube channel proves highly effective and robust at improving device-to-device consistency - hysteresis and threshold voltage variation are reduced by an average of 84 and 53\%, respectively. The effect of gate and drain-source bias on hysteresis is considered, showing strong dependence that must be accounted for when analyzing the effectiveness of a passivation layer. These results provide both key insight into the origin of variability in carbon nanotube transistors and a promising path for resolving this significant obstacle. © 2012 American Chemical Society.}

      \field{abstract}{Corrosion reliability of electronic products is a key factor for electronics industry, and today there is a large demand for performance reliability in large spans of temperature and humidity during day and night shifts. Corrosion failures are still seen due to the effects of temperature, humidity and corrosion accelerating species in the atmosphere, and moreover the surface region of printed circuit board assemblies is often contaminated by various contaminating species. In order to evaluate the level of humidity at which failures such as electrochemical migration start to appear on printed circuit board assemblies, a study of combined electric field, hygroscopic contamination and humidity on inter-digitated test comb patterns contaminated with sodium chloride and further exposed to increasing humidity has been performed. Results showed a significant increase in leakage current when only 70-75 \% RH was reached, corresponding to the deliquescence relative humidity level of NaCl. The overall effect of climate (humidity and temperature) has been studied on the internal climate of typical electronic enclosures. The varied parameters included material used for casing, s ize of opening, differential humidity, and temperature effects simulating day/night, and the use of desiccants.}

      \field{abstract}{A CMOS-like inverter was integrated by using ambipolar carbon nanotube (CNT) transistors without doping. The ambipolar CNT transistors automatically configure themselves to play a role as an n-type or p-type transistor in a logic circuit depending on the supply voltage (V DD) and ground. A NOR (NAND) gate is adaptively converted to a NAND (NOR) gate. This adaptiveness of logic gates exhibiting two logic gate functions in a single logic circuit offers a new opportunity for designing logic circuits with high integration density for next generation applications. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) provide an opportunity to achieve extremely high intrinsic carrier mobility and high current carrying capacity. 1-6 However, several obstacles with their use have been encountered. Among them, ambipolarity in Schottky barrier carbon nanotube field effect transistors (CNT-FET) is a well-known phenomenon occurring under a vacuum environment or with a top gate oxide and top gate electrode. 7,8 CNT-based CMOS technology has been realized by suppressing one of the ambipolar regions of the CNTs with p-or n-type doping. 9-20 These approaches are limited to the conventional concept of silicon devices that utilize unipolar p-and n-type transistors in the realization of CMOS. Doping of CNTs with p-or n-type to remove ambipolarity is still challenging. Here, we report a different approach that considers ambipolarity not as a drawback but as a benefit in architecturing CNT-based CMOS circuits. CMOS-like logic circuits such as inverters and NOR/NAND gates were integrated by using ambipolar CNT transistors without the use of an unreliable doping process. The key idea in this work is that ambipolar CNT transistors automatically configure themselves to play the role as n-type or p-type transistors in logic circuits depending on the exchange of the supply voltage (V DD) and ground. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that by flipping the voltage of V DD and ground, a NOR (NAND) gate can be adaptively converted to a NAND (NOR) gate. This adaptiveness of logic gates exhibiting two logic gate functions by using one logic circuit has never been demonstrated. An array of thin film transistors (TFTs) was fabricated with randomly networked single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) that were synthesized selectively on a designed array of catalyst photoresists (0.01 M of ferrocene) 21 by using a remote plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) method at low temperature (450 °C). 22 The corresponding source and drain electrodes with Ti (5 nm)/ Au (50 nm) (channel length, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10 µm; width, 40 µm; 20 channels for each length in a sample) were deposited to form an array of 200 TFTs. A conformal thin film of a top gate oxide (Al 2 O 3 , 50 nm) was deposited by an atomic layer deposition technique at 150 °C. The gate electrode (Ti (5 nm)/Au (50 nm)) was formed similarly to the source and drain electrodes. The detailed method has been described elsewhere. 21,22 Logic circuits were fabricated by connecting several TFTs with gold wire with wire bonder. I-V characteristics of the CNT-TFTs were measured under ambient conditions by a source-measure unit (Keithley 236, 237) using a probe station. Gate biases of-40 to +40 V were applied for back gate measurements and a top gate voltage of-5 to +5 V was applied at a source and drain bias of 100 mV.

      \field{abstract}{Networks of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) can be processed from solution and have excellent mechanical properties. They are highly flexible and stretchable. Depending on the type of nanotubes (semiconducting or metallic) they can be used as replacements for metal or transparent conductive oxide electrodes or as semiconducting layers for field-effect transistors (FETs) with high carrier mobilities. They are thus competitive alternatives to other solution-processable materials for flexible and printed electronics. This review introduces the basic properties of SWNTs, current methods for dispersion and separation of metallic and semiconducting SWNTs and techniques to deposit and pattern dense networks from dispersion. Recent examples of applications of carbon nanotubes as conductors and semiconductors in (opto-)electronic devices and integrated circuits will be discussed.}

      \field{abstract}{The effect of oxygen adsorption on a nanotube-based field effect transistor have been controversial as to whether it induces p-type doping of the nanotube body or the work function increase in the metal electrode. Here we report a transport measurement showing that a long individual single-walled nanotube can be doped as p-type upon oxygen adsorption. We discuss that, despite the fact that the charge transfer between the nanotube and O2 adsorbator has not been agreed to date, the effect of oxygen adsorption should still be interpreted as inducing p-type doping in the nanotube body. The n-type doping by NH3 adsorption is also measured for the purpose of comparison. Based on these observations, we suggest that, while the Schottky barrier management could be more effective for the transistor with a short nanotube, the doping effect could be more influential in devices with longer nanotubes. © 2005 IOP Publishing Ltd.}

      \field{abstract}{Aqueous surfactant dispersion is the most typical starting step to functionalize materials consisting of carbon nanotubes, but the effects of surfactants on the electronic properties are still unclear. Here we report how the functional groups of surfactants affect the electronic properties of carbon nanotube films. Using spectroscopic and thermoelectric characterization, we demonstrate that anionic and non-ionic surfactants contribute to the formation of p-type and n-type carbon nanotubes, respectively. Additionally, p-type doping with oxygen adsorption is found to compete with surfactants’ doping. These findings are useful for designing the srarting carbon nanotube materials exhibiting desirable electronic properties.}

      \field{abstract}{Aptamer-immobilized graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) have become a well-known detection platform in the field of biosensing with various biomarkers such as proteins, bacteria, virus, as well as chemicals. A conventional aptamer immobilization technique on graphene involves a two-step crosslinking process. In the first step, a pyrene derivative is anchored onto the surface of graphene and, in the second step, an amine-terminated aptamer is crosslinked to the pyrene backbone with EDC/NHS (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride/N-hydroxysuccinimide) chemistry. However, this process often requires the use of organic solvents such as dimethyl formamide (DMF) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) which are typically polar aprotic solvents and hence dissolves both polar and nonpolar compounds. The use of such solvents can be especially problematic in the fabrication of lab-on-a-chip or point-of-care diagnostic platforms as they can attack vulnerable materials such as polymers, passivation layers and microfluidic tubing leading to device damage and fluid leakage. To remedy such challenges, in this work, we demonstrate the use of pyrene-tagged DNA aptamers (PTDA) for performing a one-step aptamer immobilization technique to implement a GFET-based biosensor for the detection of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) protein biomarker. In this approach, the aptamer terminal is pre-tagged with a pyrene group which becomes soluble in aqueous solution. This obviates the need for using organic solvents, thereby enhancing the device integrity. In addition, an external electric field is applied during the functionalization step to increase the efficiency of aptamer immobilization and hence improved coverage and density. The results from this work could potentially open up new avenues for the use of GFET-based BioMEMS platforms by broadening the choice of materials used for device fabrication and integration.}

      \field{abstract}{In this work, we report a novel method of label-free detection of small molecules based on direct observation of interferometric signal change in graphene-modified glasses. The interferometric sensor chips are fabricated via a conventional wet transfer method of CVD-grown graphene onto the glass coverslips, lowering the device cost and allowing for upscaling the sensor fabrication. For the first time, we report the use of graphene functionalized by the aptamer as the bioreceptor, in conjunction with Spectral-Phase Interferometry (SPI) for detection of ochratoxin A (OTA). In a direct assay with an OTA-specific aptamer, we demonstrated a quick and significant change of the optical signal in response to the maximum tolerable level of OTA concentration. The sensor regeneration is possible in urea solution. The developed platform enables a direct method of kinetic analysis of small molecules using a low-cost optical chip with a graphene-aptamer sensing layer.}

      \field{abstract}{Graphene has received intensive research interest due to its remarkable charge mobility, and the efforts in the use of graphene-based field effect transistors (GFETs) for the sensing of biological biomarkers is on the rise. Because of the high non-specific protein adsorption on graphene, well-defined surface modification strategies have to be implemented to benefit from the excellent electronic transfer characteristics of GFET devices for specific detection of biomarkers. Surprisingly, while pyrene-based ligands are the most widely used graphene surface anchors for sensing-related applications, no systematic investigation on the reaction conditions employed and the influence of pyrene functionalities has been reported so far. As this is one of the essential steps for efficient receptor integration and sensitive sensing, by using GFET-based analysis of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) as the model compound we will show that an optimized pyrene–maleimide ligand incubation time on graphene of 2 h gives the best sensing performance. This study not only will be a guideline for researchers interested in GFET biosensors but also will hopefully allow industrial GFET development in a faster path.}

Three different aromatic hydrocarbons were used to functionalize graphene with carboxyl groups via π-π stacking interactions, and 1-pyrenebutyric acid exhibited the best result for photoreceptor protein immobilization. Besides, the modification procedure of photoreceptor protein was also optimized by using a novel protein stack way on the device. Unlike conventional self-assembly method, photoreceptor proteins were cross-linked before immobilized on graphene thin film and yielded a higher modification density. Finally, the photocurrent response was significantly enhanced from −1\% to −9.62\%. These results bring key opportunity for graphene field effect transistor based photodetection, and the surface functionalization method are expected to help achieve high sensing performance on protein-based biosensors.}

      \field{abstract}{Because avidin and biotin molecules exhibit the most specific and strongest non-covalent interaction, avidin-biotin technology is widely used in ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) kits for the detection of different bio-macromolecules linked to different diseases including cancer and influenza. Combining the outstanding electrical conductivity (200,000 cm2V-1s-1) of graphene with the unique avidin and biotin interaction, we demonstrate a novel graphene field-effect transistor (GFET) biosensor for the quantitative detection of bio-macromolecules. The GFET consists of six pairs of interdigital Cr/Au electrodes supported on Si/SiO2 substrate with an avidin immobilized single layer graphene channel as the sensing platform. By monitoring the real time current change upon the addition of biotin solution in bovine serum albumin (BSA) in the silicone pool preformed onto the GFET, the lowest detectable biotin concentration is estimated to be 90 fg/ml (0.37 pM). The specificity of the GFET is confirmed both by controlled and real sample measurements. From the magnitude of current change upon the addition of different concentrations of biotin solutions, the dissociation constant Kd is estimated to be 1.6 × 10-11 M. Since biotin is capable of conjugating with proteins, nucleotides and other bio-macromolecules without altering their properties, the present GFET sensor with its ultra-high sensitivity (0.37 pM) and specificity can be tailored to the rapid point-of-care detection of different types of desired biomolecules at very low concentration level through biotinylation as well as the exogenous biotin in blood serum.}

      \field{abstract}{It has become common to reference “pi-stacking” forces or “pi–pi interactions” when describing the interactions between neighbouring aromatic rings. Here, we review experimental and theoretical literature across several fields and conclude that the terms “pi-stacking” and “pi–pi interactions” do not accurately describe the forces that drive association between aromatic molecules of the types most commonly studied in chemistry or biology laboratories. We therefore propose that these terms are misleading and should no longer be used. Even without these terms, electrostatic considerations relating to polarized pi systems, as described by Hunter and Sanders, have provided a good qualitative starting place for predicting and understanding the interactions between aromatics for almost two decades. More recent work, however, is revealing that direct electrostatic interactions between polarized atoms of substituents as well as solvation/desolvation effects in strongly interacting solvents must also be considered and even dominate in many circumstances.}

      \field{abstract}{Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been widely studied and used for the construction of electrochemical biosensors owing to their small size, cylindrical shape, large surface-to-volume ratio, high conductivity and good biocompatibility. In electrochemical biosensors, CNTs serve a dual purpose: they act as immobilization support for biomolecules as well as provide the necessary electrical conductivity for electrochemical transduction. The ability of a recognition molecule to detect the analyte is highly dependent on the type of immobilization used for the attachment of the biomolecule to the CNT surface, a process also known as biofunctionalization. A variety of biofunctionalization methods have been studied and reported including physical adsorption, covalent cross-linking, polymer encapsulation etc. Each method carries its own advantages and limitations. In this review we provide a comprehensive review of non-covalent functionalization of carbon nanotubes with a variety of biomolecules for the development of electrochemical biosensors. This method of immobilization is increasingly being used in bioelectrode development using enzymes for biosensor and biofuel cell applications.}

      \field{abstract}{The adsorbed structure of 1-pyrenebutanoic acid succinimidyl ester (PASE) on graphene was investigated based on density functional theory. We found two locally stable structures: A straight structure with the chainlike part of butanoic acid succinimidyl ester (BSE) lying down and a bent structure with the BSE part directed away from graphene, keeping the pyrene (Py) part adsorbed on graphene. Then, to elucidate the adsorption mechanism, we separately estimated the contributions of the Py and BSE parts to the entire PASE adsorption, and the adsorption effect of the BSE part was found to be secondary in comparison to the contribution of the Py. Next, the mobility of the BSE part at room temperature was confirmed by the activation energy barrier between straight and bent structures. To take account of the external environment, we considered the presence of amino acids and the hydration effect by a three-dimensional reference interaction site model. The contributions of glycine molecules and the solvent environment to stabilizing the bent PASE structure relative to the straight PASE structure were found. Therefore, the effect of the external environment around PASE is of importance when the standing-up process of the BSE part from graphene is considered.}

      \field{abstract}{This chapter provides an overview of the major reactions used in bioconjugation techniques. Each reaction is briefly discussed and illustrated, while providing key references from the literature or other parts of the book where they have been used for bioconjugation purposes. These reactions are further organized by the general reactivity or functional group that is involved in the associated conjugation process, such as amine reactions, thiol reactions, carboxylate reactions, hydroxyl reactions, aldehyde and ketone reactions, active hydrogen reactions, photochemical reactions, and cycloaddition reactions. Knowledge of the reactions of bioconjugation as discussed in this chapter combined with knowledge of the targets of bioconjugation and their functional groups as discussed in Chapter 2 can provide a firm foundation for making virtually any bioconjugate imaginable.}

      \field{abstract}{We demonstrate a highly sensitive nano aptasensor for anthrax toxin through the detection of its polypeptide entity, protective antigen (PA toxin) using a PA toxin ssDNA aptamer functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) device. The aptamer was developed inhouse by capillary electrophoresis systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (CE-SELEX) and had a dissociation constant (Kd) of 112 nM. The aptasensor displayed a wide dynamic range spanning up to 800 nM with a detection limit of 1 nM. The sensitivity was 0.11 per nM, and it was reusable six times. The aptasensor was also highly selective for PA toxin with no interference from human and bovine serum albumin, demonstrating it as a potential tool for rapid and point-of-care diagnosis for anthrax. © 2010 American Chemical Society.}

      \field{abstract}{Synthetic DNA aptamer receptors could boost the prospects of carbon nanotube (CNT)-based electronic biosensors if signal transduction can be understood and engineered. Here, we report CNT aptasensors for potassium ions that clearly demonstrate aptamer-induced electrostatic gating of electronic conduction. The CNT network devices were fabricated on flexible substrates via a facile solution processing route and non-covalently functionalised with potassium binding aptamers. Monotonic increases in CNT conduction were observed in response to increasing potassium ion concentration, with a level of detection as low as 10 picomolar. The signal was shown to arise from a specific aptamer-target interaction that stabilises a G-quadruplex structure, bringing high negative charge density near the CNT channel. Electrostatic gating is established via the specificity and the sign of the current response, and by observing its suppression when higher ionic strength decreases the Debye length at the CNT-water interface. Sensitivity towards potassium and selectivity against other ions is demonstrated in both resistive mode and real time transistor mode measurements. The effective device architecture presented, along with the identification of clear response signatures, should inform the development of new electronic biosensors using the growing library of aptamer receptors.}

      \field{abstract}{As a two-dimensional material with high charge carrier mobility, graphene may offer ultrahigh sensitivity in biosensing. To realize this, the first step is to functionalize the graphene. This is commonly done by using 1-pyrenebutyric acid (PBA) as a linker for biomolecules. However, the adsorption of PBA on graphene remains poorly understood despite reports of successful biosensors functionalized via this route. Here, the PBA adsorption on graphene is characterized through a combination of Raman spectroscopy, ab initio calculations, and spectroscopic ellipsometry. The PBA molecules are found to form a self-assembled monolayer on graphene, the formation of which is self-limiting and Langmuirian. Intriguingly, in concentrated solutions, the PBA molecules are found to stand up and stack horizontally with their edges contacting the graphene surface. This morphology could facilitate a surface densely populated with carboxylic functional groups. Spectroscopic analyses show that the monolayer saturates at 5.3 PBA molecules per nm2 and measures ∼0.7 nm in thickness. The morphology study of this PBA monolayer sheds light on the π-π stacking of small-molecule systems on graphene and provides an excellent base for optimizing functionalization procedures.}

      \field{abstract}{Surprisingly few details have been reported in the literature that help the experimentalist to determine the conditions necessary for the preparation of self-assembled monolayers on graphene with a high surface coverage. With a view to graphene-based sensing arrays and devices and, in particular, in view of graphene-based varactors for gas sensing, graphene was modified in this work by the π-πinteraction-driven self-assembly of 10 pyrene and cyclodextrin derivatives from solution. The receptor compounds were pyrene, pyrene derivatives with hydroxyl, carboxyl, ester, ammonium, amino, diethylamino, and boronic acid groups, and perbenzylated α-, β-, and γ-cyclodextrins. Adsorption of these compounds onto graphene was quantified by contact-angle measurements and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Data thus obtained were fitted with the Langmuir adsorption model to determine the equilibrium constants for surface adsorption and the concentrations of self-assembly solutions needed to form dense monolayers on graphene. The equilibrium constants of all pyrene derivatives fell into the range from 103.4 to 104.6 M-1. For the perbenzylated α-, β-, and γ-cyclodextrins, the equilibrium constants are 103.24, 102.97, and 102.95 M-1, respectively. Monolayers of 1-pyrenemethylammonium chloride on graphene were confirmed to be stable under heating to 100 °C in a high vacuum (2 × 10-5 Torr).}

      \field{abstract}{Aptameric graphene-based field-effect transistors (A-GFETs) always employ linkers, which could immobilize on graphene through Ï-πstacking between contained pyrenyl groups and graphene, to anchor aptamers. Aptamer density is closely associated with the A-GFET sensitivity and determined by the linker density. Using known linker immobilization methods, the linker density is random, uncontrollable, and limited. In this work, we propose a novel linker immobilization method which can be used to effectively modulate the linker density using an electric field and further bridge the relationship between the linker density and the A-GFET sensitivity. Here, polar molecule 1-pyrenebutanoic acid succinimidyl ester (PASE) is used as a linker representative. In the electric field, PASE is arranged regularly with the electron-rich pyrenyl group forced toward graphene in the solution due to electrostatic repulsion, thereby making it possible to modulate the quantity of PASE molecules that could interact with graphene by tuning the electric field application and then realizing the regulation of the A-GFET sensitivity. Experimental results indicate that the limits of detection (LODs) of A-GFETs for detecting interleukin-6 (IL-6) and insulin can be significantly improved to be 618 and 766 fM, respectively, by applying an electric field at-0.3 V for 3 h during PASE immobilization.}

      \field{abstract}{Electrochemical, aptamer-based (E-AB) sensors, which are comprised of an electrode modified with surface immobilized, redox-tagged DNA aptamers, have emerged as a promising new biosensor platform. In order to further improve this technology we have systematically studied the effects of probe (aptamer) packing density, the AC frequency used to interrogate the sensor, and the nature of the self-assembled monolayer (SAM) used to passivate the electrode on the performance of representative E-AB sensors directed against the small molecule cocaine and the protein thrombin. We find that, by controlling the concentration of aptamer employed during sensor fabrication, we can control the density of probe DNA molecules on the electrode surface over an order of magnitude range. Over this range, the gain of the cocaine sensor varies from 60\% to 200\%, with maximum gain observed near the lowest probe densities. In contrast, over a similar range, the signal change of the thrombin sensor varies from 16\% to 42\% and optimal signaling is observed at intermediate densities. Above cut-offs at low hertz frequencies, neither sensor displays any significant dependence on the frequency of the alternating potential employed in their interrogation. Finally, we find that E-AB signal gain is sensitive to the nature of the alkanethiol SAM employed to passivate the interrogating electrode; while thinner SAMs lead to higher absolute sensor currents, reducing the length of the SAM from 6-carbons to 2-carbons reduces the observed signal gain of our cocaine sensor 10-fold. We demonstrate that fabrication and operational parameters can be varied to achieve optimal sensor performance and that these can serve as a basic outline for future sensor fabrication. © 2008 American Chemical Society.}

      \field{abstract}{Present work describes the methylene blue tagged thiolated aptamer-modified gold micro-array based biosensor for specific detection of IFN-γ. The microchips with the microelectrode array were fabricated using standard silicon microfabrication technologies, and modified with methylene blue tagged aptamer using standard gold thiol chemistry. Electrodes were characterized and tested using Cyclic Voltammetric (CV) and Square Wave Voltammetry (SQW) measurements in a standard three-electrode format at room temperature. On an aptamer modified electrode, aptamer density was estimated to be about 4.4×1012molecules/cm2. In IFN-γ studies, oxidation peak currents were found to decrease and more than 50\% signal suppression was achieved at 500ng/ml. Further, the magnitude of signal suppression was found to be logarithmically proportional to the IFN-γ in the concentration range of 1-500ng/ml, with a detection limit of 1.3ng/ml (i.e. 0.8fmol in used sample volume of 10μl). Biosensor showed negligible signal changes (5\%) in a very high non-specific protein background, while still able to differentiate target protein IFN-γ at 5ng/ml. The results indicated that our sensor binds selectively to target molecules, and the non-specific binding where adsorption of BSA protein molecules may be effectively omitted from consideration.© 2013 .}

This chapter describes the properties and reactivities of crosslinking compounds that contain identical reactive groups on both ends. The chapter is divided into sections based upon the functional group reactivities of each reagent type, such as amine-reactive, thiol-reactive, carbonyl-reactive, and nonspecific photoreactive compounds. The crossbridges of these reagents also can be designed to provide permanent or cleavable bonds or, hydrophilic or hydrophobic properties, or to make available long or short linkages between molecules. Homobifunctional crosslinkers have been used for decades to form protein conjugates, capture protein interactions within cells, and to immobilize affinity molecules onto solid-phase supports.}

      \field{abstract}{All-electronic DNA biosensors based on graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) offer the prospect of simple and cost-effective diagnostics. For GFET sensors based on complementary probe DNA, the sensitivity is limited by the binding affinity of the target oligonucleotide, in the nM range for 20 mer targets. We report a ∼20 000× improvement in sensitivity through the use of engineered hairpin probe DNA that allows for target recycling and hybridization chain reaction. This enables detection of 21 mer target DNA at sub-fM concentration and provides superior specificity against single-base mismatched oligomers. The work is based on a scalable fabrication process for biosensor arrays that is suitable for multiplexed detection. This approach overcomes the binding-affinity-dependent sensitivity of nucleic acid biosensors and offers a pathway toward multiplexed and label-free nucleic acid testing with high accuracy and selectivity.}

      \field{abstract}{Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a gene sequence are markers for a variety of human diseases. Detection of SNPs with high specificity and sensitivity is essential for effective practical implementation of personalized medicine. Current DNA sequencing, including SNP detection, primarily uses enzyme-based methods or fluorophore-labeled assays that are time-consuming, need laboratory-scale settings, and are expensive. Previously reported electrical charge-based SNP detectors have insufficient specificity and accuracy, limiting their effectiveness. Here, we demonstrate the use of a DNA strand displacement-based probe on a graphene field effect transistor (FET) for high-specificity, single-nucleotide mismatch detection. The single mismatch was detected by measuring strand displacement-induced resistance (and hence current) change and Dirac point shift in a graphene FET. SNP detection in large double-helix DNA strands (e.g., 47 nt) minimize false-positive results. Our electrical sensor-based SNP detection technology, without labeling and without apparent cross-hybridization artifacts, would allow fast, sensitive, and portable SNP detection with single-nucleotide resolution. The technology will have a wide range of applications in digital and implantable biosensors and high-throughput DNA genotyping, with transformative implications for personalized medicine.}

      \field{abstract}{Physiological and emotional stress affects the regulation of cortisol secretion, a routine process in circadian rhythm. Regular monitoring of cortisol level as a biomarker in the blood stream becomes vital to determine cortisol-related diseases. This study reports immuno-probed graphene nanoplatelets on electrolyte-gated field-effect transistor (EGFET) biosensor for cortisol determination in human serum. Solution-processed graphene nanoplatelets were evidenced on the surface by Raman spectroscopy analysis and utilized as the transducing element on the field-effect transistor. Further, confirmed the binding events of the antibody on graphene nanoplatelets using X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy and characterized the electrostatic gating effect of cortisol and intermediate functionalization on graphene nanoplatelets-EGFET. The biosensor exhibited good sensitivity of 72.30 µA.(g/mL)−1 in a linear range between 1.00 pg/mL to 10.00 ng/mL, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.85 pg/mL. Confirmation with binding events on the biosensor was done using the relevant molecules, progesterone, cortisone, and corticosterone, and found to be selective towards cortisol. Cortisol was also successfully detected with interference by the human serum, suggesting the capability of graphene nanoplatelets-EGFET sensor for determining cortisol in a complex matrix.}

The SNP-level target specificity is achieved by immobilization of probe DNA on the graphene surface through a pyrene-derivative heterobifunctional linker. Biorecognition events result in a positive gate voltage shift of the graphene charge neutrality point. The graphene transistor biosensor displays a sensitivity of 24 mV/dec with a detection limit of 25 aM: The lowest target DNA concentration for which the sensor can discriminate between a perfect-match target sequence and SNP-containing one.}

      \field{abstract}{Reliable determination of binding kinetics and affinity of DNA hybridization and single-base mismatches plays an essential role in systems biology, personalized and precision medicine. The standard tools are optical-based sensors that are difficult to operate in low cost and to miniaturize for high-throughput measurement. Biosensors based on nanowire field-effect transistors have been developed, but reliable and cost-effective fabrication remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate that a graphene single-crystal domain patterned into multiple channels can measure time- and concentration-dependent DNA hybridization kinetics and affinity reliably and sensitively, with a detection limit of 10 pM for DNA. It can distinguish single-base mutations quantitatively in real time. An analytical model is developed to estimate probe density, efficiency of hybridization and the maximum sensor response. The results suggest a promising future for cost-effective, high-throughput screening of drug candidates, genetic variations and disease biomarkers by using an integrated, miniaturized, all-electrical multiplexed, graphene-based DNA array.}

      \field{abstract}{31 Small solid-state devices are candidates for accelerating biomedical assays/drug discovery, 32 however their potential remains unfulfilled. Here, we demonstrate that graphene-field 33 effect transistors (FET) can be used to successfully detect the key molecular events 34 underlying viral infections and the effect of antiviral drugs. Our device success is achieved 35 by bio-mimicking the host-cell surface during an influenza infection at the graphene 36 channel. In-situ AFM confirms the biological interactions at the sialic acid-functionalized 37 graphene: viral hemagglutinin (HA) binds to sialic acid, and neuraminidase (NA) reacts 38 with the sialic acid-HA complex. The graphene-FET detects HA binding to sialic acid, and 39 NA cleavage of sialic acid. The inhibitory effect of the drug "zanamivir" on NA-sialic 40 acid interactions is monitored in real-time; the reaction rate constant of NA-sialic acid 41 reaction was successfully determined. We demonstrate that graphene-FETs are powerful 42 platforms for measurement of biomolecular interactions and contribute to future 43 deployment of solid-state devices in drug discovery/biosensing. 44 45 46}

      \field{abstract}{This paper presents a simple and sensitive method for the real-time detection of a prostate cancer marker (PSA-ACT complex) through label-free protein biosensors based on a carbon nanotube field effect transistor (CNT-FET). Herein, the CNT-FET was functionalized with a solution containing various linker-to-spacer ratios, the binding event of the target PSA-ACT complex onto the receptor detected by monitoring the gating effect caused by charges in the target PSA-ACT complex. Since the biosensors were used in a buffer solution, it was crucial to control the distance between the receptors through introduction of linkers and spacers so that the charged target PSA-ACT complex could easily approach the CNT surface within the Debye length to give a large gating effect. The results show that CNT-FET biosensors modified with only linkers could not detect target proteins unless a very high concentration of the PSA-ACT complex solution (∼500 ng/ml) was injected, while those modified with a 1:3 ratio of linker-to-spacer could detect 1.0 ng/ml without any pretreatment. Moreover, our linker and spacer-modified CNT-FET could successfully block non-target proteins and selectively detect the target protein in human serum. Significantly, this strategy can be applied to general antibody-based detection schemes and enables production of very simple and sensitive electronic biosensors to detect clinically important biomarkers for disease diagnosis. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

      \field{abstract}{Conductive materials functionalized with redox enzymes provide bioelectronic architectures with application to biological fuel cells and biosensors. Effective electron transfer between the enzyme (biocatalyst) and the conductive materials is imperative for function. Various nanostructured carbon materials are common electrode choices for these applications as both the materials' inherent conductivity and physical integrity aids optimal performance. The following chapter presents a method for the use of carbon nanotube buckypaper as a conductive architecture suitable for biocatalyst functionalization. In order to securely attach the biocatalyst to the carbon nanotube surface, the conductive buckypaper is modified with the heterobifunctional cross-linker, 1-pyrenebutanoic acid, succinimidyl ester. The technique effectively tethers the enzyme to the carbon nanotube which enhances bioelectrocatalysis, preserves the conductive nature of the carbon surface, and facilities direct electron transfer between the catalyst and material interface. The approach is demonstrated using phenol oxidase (laccase) and pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent glucose dehydrogenase PQQ-GDH, as representative biocatalysts. © Springer Science+Business Media, New York 2013.}

      \field{abstract}{DlMETHYL sulfoxide (DMSO) has been known for over a century, but only recently has it been made on an industrial scale. It is becoming of increasing importance as a versatile solvent and as an intermediate in synthetic processes. Its solvent properties have been demonstrated for a number of gases (14), liquids (1), certain salts (1), and a variety of polymers (5, 9-12). Dimethyl sulfoxide is a colorless, water-soluble, hygro-scopic, slightly alkaline organic liquid which boils at 189 °C. and freezes at 18.5 °C, It has only a slight odor and is nontoxic. Water and DMSO are miscible in all proportions, and like many other solvent-water systems (13) the physical properties of the mixtures are not related linearly to those of each constituent. In a current series of investigations of the physico-chemical properties of the hemicelluloses (7,8), DMSO was used as a solvent for a variety of hardwood xylans. Under certain conditions, addition of water improved its solvent properties. For such studies, information was required on viscosity, density, refractive index, and hygroscopicity of DMSO-water mixtures. Accordingly, these measurements were undertaken. Very few data on the physical properties of the system DMSO-water are available in the literature; therefore, it was considered worthwhile to report these results. Considerable care was taken in the distillation of the DMSO to remove as much water as possible. The water content, estimated by an infrared technique, could be reduced to 0.10\% by vacuum distillation over Drierite. Refractive index, viscosity, and density from 0 to 100\% water content are given in Table I and plotted in Figure 1.}

      \field{abstract}{Carbon nanotube transistors are a promising platform for the next generation of nonoptical biosensors. However, the exact nature of the biomolecule interactions with nanotubes in these devices remains unknown, creating one of the major obstacles to their practical use. We assembled alternating layers of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes on the carbon nanotube transistors to mimic gating of these devices by charged molecules. The devices showed reproducible oscillations of the transistor threshold voltage depending on the polarity of the outer polymer layer in the multilayer film. This behavior shows excellent agreement with the predictions of a simple electrostatic model. Finally, we demonstrate that complex interactions of adsorbed species with the device substrate and the surrounding electrolyte can produce significant and sometimes unexpected effects on the device characteristics. © 2006 American Chemical Society.}

      \field{abstract}{We demonstrate the use of individual semiconducting single-wall carbon nanotubes as versatile biosensors. Controlled attachment of the redox enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx) to the nanotube sidewall is achieved through a linking molecule and is found to induce a clear change of the conductance. The enzyme-coated tube is found to act as a pH sensor with large and reversible changes in conductance upon changes in pH. Upon addition of glucose, the substrate of GOx, a steplike response can be monitored in real time, indicating that our sensor is also capable of measuring enzymatic activity at the level of a single nanotube. This first demonstration of nanotube-based biosensors provides a new tool for enzymatic studies and opens the way to biomolecular diagnostics.}

The dielectric constants were determined by using a new setup based on a low-pass filter. The obtained dielectric constant values are compared with those reported in the literature, and are consistent with those reported in the literature. The obtained dielectric constant data were also compared with those calculated by the Kirkwood model. The comparisons indicated that Kirkwood model can be successfully used for calculation of dielectric constants of the pure fluids. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.}

      \field{abstract}{Relative permittivities (εr) have been measured at two frequencies with an expanded (k = 2) uncertainty of 0.1 using a re-entrant radio frequency resonator in the pressure range (0.1 to 5) MPa at temperatures from (278 to 328) K for N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and (293 to 328) K for dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). At 298.15 K and 0.1 MPa, the assessed literature averages of 38.4 ± 1.8 and 47.3 ± 1.8 for DMF and DMSO, respectively, are consistent with the values of 37.2 ± 0.1 and 46.0 ± 0.1 determined in this work. Possible sources of uncertainty are discussed. An empirical description of εr(p,T) is given that can be used to calculate the temperature and pressure derivatives of εr. Kirkwood g factors calculated using the present data show only minimal dipole-dipole correlations for both DMF and DMSO. © 2010 American Chemical Society.}

      \field{abstract}{Water-soluble carbodiimides are widely used for carboxylamine conjugation. However, extremely variable and low yields, obtained under a variety of conditions, have been a serious problem in the coupling. A simple method, optimizing various parameters of the coupling reaction, in which N-hydroxysuccinimide is included to assist the 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride-catalyzed amidation reaction is described. A product yield of up to 90\% is routinely achieved. © 1994 Academic Press, Inc.}

      \field{abstract}{The use of particles in biological assays and other applications dates back many decades (Singer and Plotz, 1956). Assays and detection systems made by coupling affinity ligands to particles of nanometer or micrometer diameter have been used in diagnostic tests and numerous other research procedures. Latex microspheres and gold nanoparticles were perhaps the earliest examples of solid-phase spheres used for these purposes. With the recent explosion in nanotechnology, the relevant particle size has shrunk by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude and the applications for particles have dramatically expanded. Nanoparticles and micropar-ticles are used in agglutination tests and assays, particle capture ELISA methods, lateral flow tests, solid-phase assays, scintillation proximity assays, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, superparamagnetic-based assays and magnetic separation systems and biosensors; as enhancers of Raman spectral signals; in light-scattering assays; in drug delivery applications; and as fluorescent labels or stains for detecting biological molecules (Bulte and Modo, 2008; Carregal-Romero et al., 2012; Otsuka et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2012; Yurt et al., 2012).}

      \field{abstract}{We investigated the noncovalent functionalization of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) by an aromatic chemical, 1-pyrenebutyric acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (PANHS), and produced four protein- (fibrinogen, γ-globulin, hemoglobin, and fibronectin) protected gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) by a simple strategy. The formation of protein-protected AuNPs was evidenced by UV-vis spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the successful chemical modification of MWCNTs with PANHS was identified by XPS and Raman spectra, and the MWCNT-AuNP hybrids were observed by TEM. We concluded that proteins can mediate the assembly of protein-protected AuNPs on PANHS-functionalized MWCNTs. Proteins, as an intermediate that can react with both MWCNTs and AuNPs, play a significant role for mediating the formation of different hybrids based on MWCNTs. This work provides a simple and potent strategy to prepare CNT-NP hybrids by using the interaction between CNTs and biomacromolecules, and on the other hand provides a potential application of protein-protected metallic NPs for preparing novel nanomaterials. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

      \field{abstract}{Hybrid nanocomposite of Zn-Al-In mixed metal oxides (ZnAlIn-MMO) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) was synthesized effectively from composite precursor of ternary Zn-Al-In layered double hydroxide (ZnAlIn-LDH) and 1-pyrenebutyric acid-modified CNTs (P-CNTs). The structural, morphological and optical properties of the materials were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), low temperature nitrogen adsorption-desorption, Raman spectra, and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The results indicated that ZnAlIn-LDH nanoparticles could be attached closely onto the surface of the P-CNTs through the interfacial interaction, thus resulting in the formation of the remarkably dispersed ZnAlIn-MMO nanoparticles on the surface of the modified nanotubes after calcination. Compared with pristine ZnAlIn-MMO, as-synthesized hybrid ZnAlIn-MMO/P-CNTs had smaller band gap of about 2.08 eV, characteristic of enhanced visible light absorption. Furthermore, ZnAlIn-MMO/P-CNTs exhibited excellent visible-light-induced photodegradation activity toward methylene blue, which was attributable to the efficient separation and transportation of the photogenerated charge carriers originating from the unique heterostructure of such nanocomposite. The present finding provides an approach to fabricate new types of visible-light-induced heteronanostructured photocatalysts. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}

      \field{abstract}{Although enzymes are attractive catalysts due to their own specificity, industrial applications have been hampered because of their cost, reusability, and easy deactivation under conditions far from their optimum. Immobilization has been the most popular and successful approach to overcome these limitations and enable enzymes to be used in large scale industrial processes. Recent progress in nanotechnology leads research interests toward the immobilized enzyme on/into nanoscale support material. In this study, carbon nanopowder and single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) were selected as the immobilization support and non-covalent functionalization method was developed using 1-pyrene butyric acid in order to retain the unique properties of the carbon nanomaterial. Tyrosinase, glucose oxidase, and lipase B were immobilized on the support and showed high loading densities; 2.09 mg tyrosinase, 0.626 mg lipase B, and 2.50 mg glucose oxidase per mg support, respectively. The isotherm curve fitted for Langmuir model indicated that high loading densities were based on the monolayer coverage of full surface, not multi-layer aggregation. We attempted zeta-potential analysis for determining the influential factor affecting the loading density and consequently it was validated that the electrostatic interaction between the enzyme and the support is the critical factor on the high loading density in not only simple adsorption but also in covalent immobilization. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

      \field{abstract}{The homogeneous nanocomposites of 1-pyrene butyric acid modified nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (PBANCNTs) are synthesized for the immobilization of enzymes and glucose biosensing. Through the aqueous carbodiimide coupling chemistry, glucose oxidase (GOD) is covalently immobilized on the surface of the as-prepared PBA/NCNTs with high enzyme loading (1.986 nmolcm-2). Fast direct electron transfer between GOD and the electrode is observed with the electron transfer rate constant (ks) of 2.43 s-1. Besides, the GOD/PBA/NCNTs-based biosensor exhibits a linear response to glucose concentrations ranging from 2 μM to 0.2 mM with the detection limit of 1.33 μM and the high sensitivity of 179.76 μA mM-1·cm-2. Furthermore, this biosensor is also applied to detect glucose in the human serum samples with high accuracy. These results demonstrate that the PBA/NCNTs nanocomposites can be a promising platform for immobilizing biomolecules and biosensing application. © 2001-2012 IEEE.}

      \field{abstract}{The combination of optimized and passivated Field Effect Transistors (FETs) based on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) together with the appropriate choice and immobilization strategy of aptamer receptors and buffer concentration have allowed the highly sensitive and real time biorecognition of proteins in a liquid-gated configuration. Specifically we have followed the biorecognition process of thrombin by its specific aptamer. The aptamer modified device is sensitive enough to capture a change in the electronic detection mechanism, one operating at low protein concentrations and the other in a higher target concentration range. The high sensitivity of the device is also sustained by the very low detection limits achieved (20 pM) and their high selectivity when other target proteins are used. Moreover, the experimental results have allowed us to quantify the equilibrium constant of the protein–aptamer binding and confirm its high affinity by using the Langmuir equation.}

Interfacing of these carbon nanotubes with neurons can be controlled by chemical modifications. In this study, we investigated how chemical surface functionalization of multi-walled carbon nanotube arrays (MWNT-A) influences neuronal adhesion and network organization. Functionalization of MWNT-A dramatically modifies the length of neurite fascicles, cluster inter-connection success rate, and the percentage of neurites that escape from the clusters. We propose that chemical functionalization represents a method of choice for developing applications in which neuronal patterning on MWNT-A substrates is required. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.}

      \field{abstract}{Graphene as a transducer material has produced some of the best-performing sensing approaches to date opening the door toward integrated miniaturized all-carbon point-of-care devices. Addressing this opportunity, laser-scribed graphene (LSG) electrodes are demonstrated here as highly sensitive and reliable biosensor transducers in blood serum analysis. These flexible electrodes with large electrochemical surface areas were fabricated using a direct-write laser process on polyimide foils. A universal immobilization approach is established by anchoring 1-pyrenebutyric acid to the graphene and subsequently covalently attaching an aptamer against the coagulation factor thrombin as an exemplary bioreceptor to the carboxyl groups. The resulting biosensor displays extremely low detection limits of 1 pM in buffer and 5 pM in the complex matrix of serum.}

      \field{abstract}{Despite the great promise of carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNT FETs) for applications in chemical and biochemical detection, a quantitative understanding of sensor responses is lacking. To explore the role of electrostatics in sensor transduction, experiments were conducted with a set of highly similar compounds designed to adsorb onto the CNT FET via a pyrene linker group and take on a set of known charge states under ambient conditions. Acidic and basic species were observed to induce threshold voltage shifts of opposite sign, consistent with gating of the CNT FET by local charges due to protonation or deprotonation of the pyrene compounds by interfacial water. The magnitude of the gate voltage shift was controlled by the distance between the charged group and the CNT. Additionally, functionalization with an uncharged pyrene compound showed a threshold shift ascribed to its molecular dipole moment. This work illustrates a method for producing CNT FETs with controlled values of the turnoff gate voltage, and more generally, these results will inform the development of quantitative models for the response of CNT FET chemical and biochemical sensors. © 2012 American Chemical Society.}

      \field{abstract}{Biodevices, which are obtained by immobilizing a biological functional molecule such as an enzyme or an antibody onto a conductive material surface, can be applied to biosensors and bio-fuel cells as a conversion and recognition element. In this study, we focus on carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which are utilized as scaffolding to facilitate electron transfer between the enzyme and electrodes. In order to achieve efficient enzymatic catalytic reactions on the CNT surface, we prepared a CNT-enzyme composite material by immobilizing an enzyme such that the active center of the enzyme was aligned with the direction of the bulk of the electrolyte solution. Multi copper oxidase from hyperthermophilic archaea Pyrobaculum aerophilium (Mcop) was immobilized onto the CNT surface with a high degree of orientation and the electrochemical characteristics of the resultant electrode are evaluated. The MWCNT-McoP modified electrode exhibited a current density of 190 μA/cm2 without a mediator. Proper immobilization of McoP onto the CNT surface facilitated direct electron transfer (DET) between the CNT and McoP via the four copper atoms in McoP without a mediator.}

      \field{abstract}{Although metalloproteins or metal-binding proteins have been ascertained to be associated with human health and diseases, the roles of metalloproteins in disease processes are not fully understood and require further comprehensive exploration. Immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) was initially developed for the purification of polyhistidine-tagged proteins, and subsequently for the analysis of phosphorylated proteins. Upon incorporation of different metal ions [e.g., Co(II), Cu(II)] onto solid resin, IMAC was further extended to track or enrich metal-binding proteins to elucidate their biological processes in various prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. This chapter summarizes the progress of IMAC in metalloproteomics and phosphoproteomics, providing deeper insights into the mode of action of essential metal ions and metal-based drugs as well as the role of phosphorylated proteins in multiple cellular processes.}

      \field{abstract}{Streptavidin and its homologs (together referred to as streptavidin) are widely used in molecular science owing to their highly selective and stable interaction with biotin. Other factors also contribute to the popularity of the streptavidin-biotin system, including the stability of the protein and various chemical and enzymatic biotinylation methods available for use with different experimental designs. The technology has enjoyed a renaissance of a sort in recent years, as new streptavidin variants are engineered to complement native proteins and novel methods of introducing selective biotinylation are developed for in vitro and in vivo applications. There have been notable developments in the areas of catalysis, cell biology, and proteomics in addition to continued applications in the more established areas of detection, labeling and drug delivery. This review summarizes recent advances in streptavidin engineering and new applications based on the streptavidin-biotin interaction. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.}

      \field{abstract}{One of the most popular methods of noncovalent conjugation is to make use of the natural strong bind-ing of (strept)avidin for the small molecule biotin. The strength of the (strept)avidin–biotin interaction has made it a useful tool in specific targeting applications and assay design. Since each (strept)avidin molecule contains a maximum of four biotin-binding sites, the interaction can be used to enhance the signal strength in immunoassay systems. Modification reagents that can add a functional bio-tin group to proteins, nucleic acids, and other molecules now come in many shapes and reactivities (Section 6, this chapter, and Chapter 18, Section 1.3). Depending on the functionality present on the biotinylation com-pound, specific reactive groups on antibodies or other proteins may be modified to create a (strept)avidin binding site. Amines, carboxylates, sulfhydryls, and carbohydrate groups can be specifically targeted for bio-tinylation through the appropriate choice of biotin deriv-ative. In addition, photoreactive biotinylation reagents (Section 6.5, this chapter) are used to add nonselectively a biotin group to molecules containing no convenient functional groups for modification. In this manner, oligo-nucleotide probes often are modified for detection with (strept)avidin conjugates (Chapter 23, Section 2.3). The following sections discuss the concept and use of the (strept)avidin–biotin interaction in bioconjugate techniques. Preparation of biotinylated molecules and (strept)avidin conjugates also are reviewed with sug-gested protocols. For a discussion of the major bio-tinylation reagents, see Section 6, this chapter, and Chapter 18, Section 1.3.}

      \field{abstract}{The binding between biotin and streptavidin or avidin is one of the strongest known non-covalent biological interactions. The (strept)avidin-biotin interaction has been widely used for decades in biological research and biotechnology. Therefore labeling of purified proteins by biotin is a powerful way to achieve protein capture, immobilization, and functionalization, as well as multimerizing or bridging molecules. Chemical biotinylation often generates heterogeneous products, which may have impaired function. Enzymatic biotinylation with E. coli biotin ligase (BirA) is highly specific in covalently attaching biotin to the 15 amino acid AviTag peptide, giving a homogeneous product with high yield. AviTag can conveniently be added genetically at the N-terminus, C-terminus, or in exposed loops of a target protein. We describe here procedures for AviTag insertion by inverse PCR, purification of BirA fused to glutathione-S - transferase (GST-BirA) from E. coli, BirA biotinylation of purified protein, and gel-shift analysis by SDS- PAGE to quantify the extent of biotinylation.}

      \field{abstract}{Synthetic and natural polymers have been used extensively as scaffolds and modification agents in bioconjugate design. The addition of a core polymer scaffold to a conjugate that consists of two or more components can provide multipoint attachment sites to add more copies of each molecule to the final complex. Alternatively, hydrophilic linear or branched polymers can be used to modify a biomolecule or a conjugate to provide increased water solubility, lower nonspecific binding, or protection against degradation. In addition, crosslinkers and modification reagents made with PEG cross-bridges can provide a dramatic increase in bioconjugate solubility and prevent aggregation or precipitation in aqueous buffers. This chapter reviews the major polymer options commonly used in bioconjugate construction, including their structures, properties, and the available functional or reactive groups present to use for conjugation purposes. It is divided into two main categories; the first involves discrete polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based reagents, including crosslinkers and modification agents, and the second involves much larger polymers for use as modifiers or multivalent scaffolds.}

      \field{abstract}{Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have become increasingly exploited in biological applications, such as imaging and drug delivery. The application of SWNTs in biological settings requires the surface chemistry to remain through the low solubility in aqueous media. In this research, a facile approach for the preparation of a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated SWNT-based nanocarrier was reported. We focused on the effect of PEG chain length and SWNT size on the cytotoxicity of PEG-coated SWNTs as a superior drug delivery nanovector. First, all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were employed to explore the stability and behavior of SWNT/pyrene-PEG (SWNT/Pyr-PEG) structures at a molecular level that is not attainable with experiments. The MD studies revealed that (i) π-π stacking interactions between the pyrene bearing PEG molecules and SWNTs are maintained in bulky situations, regardless of PEG molecular weight or SWNT size; (ii) pyrene molecules diffuse over the SWNT surface without detaching; and (iii) both short and long dynamic Pyr-PEG chains have the capability of effectively coating the SWNT surface. In light of the simulations, noncovalent (π-π stacking) assemblies of SWNT/Pyr-PEG with different molecular weights of PEG (Mw = 2000, 5000, and 12000) were successfully fabricated and characterized. For longer PEG chains, more effective coating of SWNTs was obtained, resulting in more biocompatible SWNT/Pyr-PEG nanomaterials. The number of SWNTs coated by Pyr-PEG was highly dependent on the length of pyrene bearing PEG polymers. Moreover, the short SWNTs showed a higher amount of PEG coating with respect to the long SWNTs. Cell viability results demonstrated a dose-dependent cytotoxicity of coated SWNTs. Short SWNTs coated with longer PEG chains have low cytotoxicity to be used in in vivo studies.}

      \field{abstract}{We report the use of fluorescein-polyethylene glycol (Fluor-PEG) to noncovalently functionalize single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) for obtaining water-soluble nanotube conjugates (Fluor-PEG/SWNT) and simultaneously affording fluorescence labels to nanotubes. We find serendipitously that fluorescein, a widely used fluorophore, can strongly adsorb onto the sidewall of the SWNTs, likely via π-stacking, and the hydrophilic PEG chain imparts high aqueous solubility. Interaction between fluorescein and SWNT is pH dependent; it weakens as the pH is increased, causing the Fluor-PEG/SWNT conjugate to be less stable at high pHs. Fluorescein molecules bound to SWNTs exhibit interesting pH-dependent optical absorbance and fluorescence properties that are distinct from free molecules, as a result of pH-dependent interactions with SWNT sidewalls. Fluorescence emission from fluorescein adsorbed on SWNT is quenched by ∼67\%, but remains sufficient and useful as a fluorescent label. The utility of Fluor-PEG/SWNT as a simultaneous fluorescent marker and an intracellular transporter is demonstrated by uptake of Fluor-PEG/SWNT by mammalian cells and detection of fluorescence inside the cells. Raman detection of SWNTs in the cells is also carried out and used to prove the co-localization of fluorescein and SWNT. Copyright © 2007 American Chemical Society.}

Subsequently, the obtained graphene is incorporated into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to fabricate PVA/graphene composites by simple solution casting. On addition of 1.0 wt\% graphene, the tensile strength and tensile modulus are increased by 178\% and 139\%, respectively. Interestingly, the strain of the composites is greatly maintained, which is related to the uniqueness interfacial structure and morphology of the composites. This work provides a promising methodology to fabricate high performance graphene-based composites with superior strength and ductility by simultaneously combining the reinforcement of graphene sheets and the uniqueness interfacial structure. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

      \field{abstract}{We present the results of computational studies of the shifts in absorption bands in the 4-hydroxybenzylidene-1,2-dimethylimidazolinone (HBDI), a synthetic analogue of the green fluorescent protein chromophore, induced by its π-stacking interaction with aromatic compounds. The set of model systems composed of HBDI in the anionic form π-stacked with the substituted derivatives of benzene is considered. Ground state equilibrium geometry parameters are obtained at the MP2/cc-pvdz level of theory and the vertical S 0,min -S 1 excitation energies are estimated using the XMCQDPT2/sa2-CASSCF(12/12) approach. It is shown that the bathochromic shifts are obtained for systems with smaller values of the dipole moment variation while the hypsochromic shifts correlate with larger values of this quantity. We also demonstrate that absolute values of the S 0,min -S 1 transition energy shift well correlate with the calculated bond interaction energy parameter of π-stacked complexes.}

      \field{abstract}{Constructing and regulating the cyanine dye aggregates have been constantly pursued because of their wide applications in photosensitizers, biological fluorescence probes, nonlinear optics, etc. However, to realize such a process using a single additive still remains a formidable challenge. Here, the aggregation and disassembly of positively charged 3,3-diethyloxadicarbocyanine iodide (DiOC 2 (5)) have been demonstrated just by changing the concentration of an artificial poly(phenylenediethynylene)-based helical foldamer (Poly-1) bearing L-alanine sodium pendants with an amide linker. Poly-1 possessed the negatively charged pendants and hydrophobic helical grooves. Upon simple mixing of equal DiOC 2 (5) and Poly-1, DiOC 2 (5) molecules were mainly enriched on Poly-1 surface driven by electrostatic interaction and arranged along the main chain of Poly-1, resulting in the formation of chiral H-aggregates. But, the excessive Poly-1 would attract some DiOC 2 (5) molecules in H-aggregates via electrostatic interaction. The isolated monomers were easy to orderly disperse into the helical grooves due to hydrophobic interaction. Meanwhile, during the aggregation and disassembly, the solution color changed from peachblow to purple red and then to purple and finally to navy blue.}

      \field{abstract}{The negative photoresist SU-8 has found widespread use as a material in the fabrication of microelectrical-mechanical systems (MEMS). Although SU-8 has been utilized as a structural material for biological MEMS, a number of SU-8 properties limit its application in these bioanalytical devices. These attributes include its brittleness, nonspecific adsorption of biomolecules, and high fluorescence in the visible wavelengths. In addition, native SU-8 is a poor substrate for cellular adhesion. Photoresists composed of resins with epoxide side groups and photoacids were screened for their ability to serve as a low-fluorescence photoresist with sufficient resolution to generate microstructures with dimensions of 5-10 μm. The fluorescence of structures formed from 1002F photoresist (1002F resin combined with triarylsulfonium hexafluoroantimonate salts) was as much as 10 times less fluorescent than similar SU-8 microstructures. The absorbance of 1002F in the visible wavelengths was also substantially lower than that of SU-8. Microstructures or pallets with an aspect ratio as high as 4:1 could be formed permitting 1002F to be used as a structural material in the fabrication of arrays of pallets for sorting adherent cells. Several different cell types were able to adhere to native 1002F surfaces, and the viability of these cells was excellent. As with SU-8, 1002F has a weak adhesion to glass, a favorable attribute when the pallet arrays are used to sort adherent cells. A threshold, laser pulse energy of 3.5 μJ was required to release individual 50 μm, 1002F pallets from an array. Relative to SU-8, 1002F photoresist offers substantial improvements as a substrate in bioanalytical devices and is likely to find widespread use in BioMEMS. © 2007 American Chemical Society.}

      \field{abstract}{We report the intrinsic water contact angle (WCA) of multilayer graphene, explore different methods of cleaning multilayer graphene, and evaluate the efficiency of those methods on the basis of spectroscopic analysis. Highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) was used as a model material system to study the wettability of the multilayer graphene surface by WCA measurements. A WCA value of 45° ± 3° was measured for a clean HOPG surface, which can serve as the intrinsic WCA for multilayer graphene. A 1 min plasma treatment (100 W) decreased the WCA to 6°, owing to the creation of surface defects and functionalization by oxygen-containing groups. Molecular dynamics simulations of water droplets on the HOPG surface with or without the oxygen-containing defect sites confirmed the experimental results. Heat treatment at near atmospheric pressure and wet chemical cleaning methods using hydrofluoric acid and chloroform did not change the WCA significantly. Low-pressure, higherature annealing under argon and hydrogen reduced the WCA to 54°, close to the intrinsic WCA of HOPG. Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy did not show any significant change for the HOPG surface after this treatment, confirming low-pressure, higherature annealing as an effective technique to clean multilayer graphene without damaging the surface. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry indicated the existence of hydrocarbon species on the surface of the HOPG sample that was exposed to air for <5 min and the absence of these impurities in the bulk. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses of the sample surfaces after the different cleaning techniques were performed to correlate the WCA to the surface chemistry. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results revealed that the WCA value changed drastically, depending on the amounts of oxygen-containing and hydrocarbon-containing groups on the surface.}

      \field{abstract}{The behavior of single layer van der Waals (vdW) materials is profoundly influenced by the immediate atomic environment at their surface, a prime example being the myriad of emergent properties in artificial heterostructures. Equally significant are adsorbates deposited onto their surface from ambient. While vdW interfaces are well understood, our knowledge regarding atmospheric contamination is severely limited. Here we show that the common ambient contamination on the surface of: graphene, graphite, hBN and MoS2 is composed of a self-organized molecular layer, which forms during a few days of ambient exposure. Using low-temperature STM measurements we image the atomic structure of this adlayer and in combination with infrared spectroscopy identify the contaminant molecules as normal alkanes with lengths of 20-26 carbon atoms. Through its ability to self-organize, the alkane layer displaces the manifold other airborne contaminant species, capping the surface of vdW materials and possibly dominating their interaction with the environment. Here, the authors attribute the ambient surface contamination of van der Waals materials to a self-organized molecular layer of normal alkanes with lengths of 20-26 carbon atoms. The alkane adlayer displaces the manifold other airborne contaminant species, capping the surface of graphene, graphite, hBN and MoS2.}

      \field{abstract}{We have demonstrated that nanocarbon materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) or graphene have an intrinsically hydrophilic nature. Addition of liquid hydrocarbons or polycyclic aromatic compounds, which are the common side-products of nanocarbon syntheses, turned the otherwise hydrophilic CNT films hydrophobic. The very small amount needed to cause this effect was not discernable by SEM or Raman spectroscopy and also it could be easily overlooked by other methods of analysis. Upon simple and rapid thermal desorption of these species we were able to fully recover the water affinity in these CNT networks. Without using any oxidizing agents the material remains hydrophilic for weeks having water contact angle of about 35°. The results pave the way towards implementation of low-dimensional nanostructures in the real life without disrupting their inherent properties.}

      \field{abstract}{Carbonaceous impurities (CIs) affect the optoelectronic properties as well as the ability to use absorption spectroscopy to estimate the metallic content of a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) dispersion. Therefore, a method for the accurate quantification and removal of CIs is required. We have devised methods to characterize and quantify CIs present in SWNT batches and to determine the effects of CIs on the optical and electrical properties of SWNT. Quantitative determination of CIs stems from the finding that chloroform selectively disperses CIs present in SWNT batches. CIs separated by dispersing the as-purchased SWNT batch in chloroform have the morphology of defective and agglomerated few-layered graphenes, whose sizes and locations depend on SWNT batches. Moreover, CIs exhibit a featureless UV-vis-mid-wavelength IR (MWIR) absorption curve and an extinction coefficient comparable to graphenes and show difference with carbon black, which is frequently used as the CI reference. The MWIR region that shows least absorptions caused by the transition of various SWNT types was utilized to assess the significant contribution made by CIs present in a surfactant-assisted SWNT dispersion, showing about 12–19 wt\% of CIs in various SWNT dispersions. In addition, the extraction of CIs with chloroform results in a highly purified SWNT batch without any diameter distribution change originating from oxidative damage as compared to the commercially available purified SWNT batch. Finally, we found that increasing the weight of CIs present in a SWNT dispersion strongly lowers the thermal conductivity of a SWNT film when compared with the electrical conductivity. This study provides a way to understand the negative effects that CI has on the optoelectronic properties of SWNTs as well as the beneficial effects of excluding ubiquitous CIs in SWNTs batches.}

      \field{abstract}{Contact angle goniometry is conducted for epitaxial graphene on SiC. Although only a single layer of epitaxial graphene exists on SiC, the contact angle drastically changes from 69° on SiC substrates to 92° on graphene. It is found that there is no thickness dependence of the contact angle from the measurements of single-, bi-, and multilayer graphene and highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). After graphene is treated with oxygen plasma, the level of damage is investigated by Raman spectroscopy and the correlation between the level of disorder and wettability is reported. By using a low-power oxygen plasma treatment, the wettability of graphene is improved without additional damage, which can solve the adhesion issues involved in the fabrication of graphene devices. © 2010 American Chemical Society.}

      \field{abstract}{Good morning Ned, Thanks for your message. Pyrene enables very strong pi-pi interactions with graphene and other carbon surfaces. At the same time pyrene is also a hydrophobic group that may result in weaker hydrophobic interactions with any surface that is hydrophobic. The interaction with graphene is much stronger than its interactions with the silicon surface. Have you tried to use non-polar solvents and perhaps even surfactants to wash the coating to remove the pyrene from silicon? Please feel free to contact us if you have any other question. Best Regards, Amy W.}

      \field{abstract}{When a spilled drop of coffee dries on a solid surface, it leaves a dense, ring-like deposit along the perimeter (Fig. 1a). The coffee—initially dispersed over the entire drop—becomes concentrated into a tiny fraction of it. Such ring deposits are common wherever drops containing dispersed solids evaporate on a surface, and they influence processes such as printing, washing and coating1,2,3,4,5. Ring deposits also provide a potential means to write or deposit a fine pattern onto a surface. Here we ascribe the characteristic pattern of the deposition to a form of capillary flow in which pinning of the contact line of the drying drop ensures that liquid evaporating from the edge is replenished by liquid from the interior. The resulting outward flow can carry virtually all the dispersed material to the edge. This mechanism predicts a distinctive power-law growth of the ring mass with time—a law independent of the particular substrate, carrier fluid or deposited solids. We have verified this law by microscopic observations of colloidal fluids.}

      \field{abstract}{Inkjet printing is of growing interest due to the attractive technologies for surface patterning. During the printing process, the solutes are transported to the droplet periphery and form a ring-like deposit, which disturbs the fabrication of high-resolution patterns. Thus, controlling the uniformity of particle coating is crucial in the advanced and extensive applications. Here, we find that sweet coffee drops above a threshold sugar concentration leave uniform rather than the ring-like pattern. The evaporative deposit changes from a ring-like pattern to a uniform pattern with an increase in sugar concentration. We moreover observe the particle movements near the contact line during the evaporation, suggesting that the sugar is precipitated from the droplet edge because of the highest evaporation and it causes the depinning of the contact line. By analyzing the following dynamics of the depinning contact line and flow fields and observing the internal structure of the deposit with a FIB-SEM system, we conclude that the depinned contact line recedes due to the solidification of sugar solution without any slip motion while suppressing the capillary flow and homogeneously fixing suspended particles, leading to the uniform coating. Our findings show that suppressing the coffee-ring effect by adding sugar is a cost-effective, easy and nontoxic strategy for improving the pattern resolution.}

      \field{abstract}{Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is an important aprotic solvent that can solubilize a wide variety of otherwise poorly soluble polar and nonpolar molecules. This, coupled with its apparent low toxicity at concentrations <10\%, has led to its ubiquitous use and widespread application. Here, we demonstrate that DMSO induces retinal apoptosis in vivo at low concentrations (5 μl intravitreally dosed DMSO in rat from a stock concentration of 1, 2, 4, and 8\% v/v). Toxicity was confirmed in vitro in a retinal neuronal cell line, at DMSO concentrations >1\% (v/v), using annexin V, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), and AlamarBlue cell viability assays. DMSO concentrations >10\% (v/v) have recently been reported to cause cellular toxicity through plasma membrane pore formation. Here, we show the mechanism by which low concentrations (2-4\% DMSO) induce caspase-3 independent neuronal death that involves apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) translocation from mitochondria to the nucleus and poly-(ADPribose)- polymerase (PARP) activation. These results highlight safety concerns of using low concentrations of DMSO as a solvent for in vivo administration and in biological assays. We recommend that methods other than DMSO are employed for solubilizing drugs but, where no alternative exists, researchers compute absolute DMSO final concentrations and include an untreated control group in addition to DMSO vehicle control to check for solvent toxicity. © FASEB.}

      \field{abstract}{Olfaction exhibits both high sensitivity for odours and high discrimination between them1. We suggest that to make fine discriminations between complex odorant mixtures containing varying ratios of odorants without the necessity for highly specialized peripheral receptors, the olfactory systems makes use of feature detection using broadly tuned receptor cells organized in a convergent neurone pathway. As a test of this hypothesis we have constructed an electronic nose using semiconductor transducers and incorporating design features suggested by our proposal. We report here that this device can reproducibly discriminate between a wide variety of odours, and its properties show that discrimination in an olfactory system could be achieved without the use of highly specific receptors.}

      \field{abstract}{Gravimetric techniques were employed to determine the adsorption capacities of commercially available purified electric arc and HiPco single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) for organic compounds (toluene, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), hexane and cyclohexane) at relative pressures, p/p0, ranging from 1 × 10-4 to 0.95 and at isothermal conditions of 25, 37 and 50 °C. The isotherms displayed both type I and type II characteristics. Adsorption isotherm modeling showed that SWNTs are heterogeneous adsorbents, and the Freundlich equation best describes the interaction between organic molecules and SWNTs. The heats of adsorption were 1-4 times the heats of vaporization, which is typical for physical adsorption of organic vapors on porous carbons. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

      \field{abstract}{Adsorption dynamics and their influence on signal transduction for carbon nanotube-based chemical sensors are explored using continuum site balance equations and a mass action model. These sensors are shown to possess both reversible and irreversible binding sites that can be modeled independently. For the case of irreversible adsorption, it is shown that the characteristic response time scales inversely with analyte concentration. It is inappropriate to report a detection limit for this type of sensor since any nonzero analyte concentration can be detected in theory but at a cost of increasing transduction time with decreasing concentration. The response curve should examine the initial rate of signal change as a function of analyte concentration. Conversely, a reversible sensor has a predefined detection limit, independent of the detector geometry with a characteristic time scaling that becomes constant in the zero analyte concentration limit. A simple analytical test is presented to distinguish between these two mechanisms from the transient response of a nanotube sensor array. Two systems appearing in the literature are shown to have an irreversible component, and regressed surface rate constants for this component are similar across different sensor geometries and analytes. © 2005 American Chemical Society.}

      \field{abstract}{This review presents the adsorptive removal process of hazardous materials onto carbon-based materials comprising activated carbon, graphene, carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, biochar and carbon aerogels. Particular emphasis is placed on the fabrication of various carbon-based substances and their characteristics. As a ubiquitous phenomenon, dangerous compounds originating from industrial wastewater lead to damage to the environment and water resources. Therefore, among conventional technologies, adsorption is highly effective and the most extensively used method owing to its simplicity of performance and fairly low cost of application for the removal of hazardous pollutants. This paper comprehensively reviews a multitude of aspects regarding the chemical and physical nature of various carbon materials and their adsorption ability by increasing their surface area or their possible modification. Based on the properties of nano-carbon materials, adsorptive elimination mechanisms for antibiotics, dyes, heavy metals, pesticides, oils, phenolic and volatile organic compounds and gas pollutants are highlighted. The advantageous characteristics of nano-carbon materials assigned to their unique adsorptive removal of common hazardous substances will be pointed out.}

      \field{abstract}{Baseline drift caused by slowly changing environment and other instability factors affects significantly the performance of gas sensors, resulting in reduced accuracy of gas classification and quantification of the electronic nose. In this work, a two-stage method is proposed for real-time sensor baseline drift compensation based on estimation theory and piecewise linear approximation. In the first stage, the linear information from the baseline before exposure is extracted for prediction. The second stage continuously predicts changing linear parameters during exposure by combining temperature change information and time series information, and then the baseline drift is compensated by subtracting the predicted baseline from the real sensor response. The proposed method is compared to three efficient algorithms and the experiments are conducted towards two simulated datasets and two surface acoustic wave sensor datasets. The experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, the proposed method can recover the true response signal under different ambient temperatures in real-time, which can guide the future design of low-power and low-cost rapid detection systems.}

      \field{abstract}{In this work, we fabricated a 2D van der Waals heterostructure device in an inert nitrogen atmosphere by means of a dry transfer technique in order to obtain a clean and largely impurity free stack of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)-encapsulated few-layer graphene. The heterostructure was contacted from the top with gold leads on two sides, and the device's properties including intrinsic charge carrier density, mobility, and contact resistance were studied as a function of temperature from 4 K to 270 K. We show that the contact resistance of the device mainly originates from the metal/graphene interface, which contributes a significant part to the total resistance. We demonstrate that current annealing affects the graphene/metal interface significantly, whereas the intrinsic carrier density and carrier mobility of the hBN-encapsulated few-layer graphene are almost unaffected, contrary to often reported mobility improvements. However, after current annealing, a 75\% reduction in the contact resistance improves the overall performance of such a heterostructure device and the backgate-dependent transfer curve becomes more symmetric with respect to the Dirac point. A maximum carrier mobility of 11 200 cm 2 V - 1 s - 1 for this hBN/graphene/hBN heterostructure was measured at 4 K, showing good device performance, in particular, after current annealing.}

      \field{abstract}{We study the effect of current-induced annealing on contact resistance between graphene and metal contacts, demonstrating that this technique may be used as an effective in-situ annealing procedure to improve the graphene-metal contact resistance which has long been an issue in the characterization of graphene-based devices. By studying as many as 30 devices with varying sample sizes and geometry, we are able to reduce the overall resistance systematically to around 400 Ω⋅μm, which is competitive with the best values obtained in the literature to treat this problem. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of current annealing in desorbing contaminants from the surface of the graphene layer, simultaneously shifting the charge-neutrality point to zero back-gate voltage, thus allowing the tuning of carrier density on both the electron and hole sides of the Dirac spectrum.}

      \field{abstract}{Novel chemical and biological sensors based on a single poly(pyrrole)-NTA chelator nanotube for sensitive, selective, rapid and real-time detection of histidine-tagged protein and cupric ions are reported. NTA groups on the nanotube surface provided a simple mechanism for metal ion sensing via the high-affinity interaction between NTA and the subsequent detection of histidine-tagged protein through the coordination with metal chelated nanotube. Poly(pyrrole)-NTA chelator nanotubes of 190 nm outside diameter, 35 nm wall thickness and 30 μm long were synthesized by electrochemical polymerization of pyrrole-NTA inside a 200 nm diameter alumina template and assembled as a chemoresistive device by bottom-up contact geometry on a pair of parallel gold electrodes with a gap distance of 3 μm. The chemoresistive sensors based on single poly(pyrrole)-NTA chelator nanotube exhibited detection as low as one-hundredth attomolar (0.6 ppt) cupric ions and 1 ng/ml of penta-histidine tagged syntaxin protein. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

      \field{abstract}{An ultrahigh performance impedimetric DNA sensor is presented showing detection limits in the femtomolar range. This electrochemical setup was constructed initially by electrogeneration of poly(11-pyrrol-1-yl-undecanoic acid Nα′,Nα-bis(carboxymethyl)-L-lysine amide) (poly-(pyrrole-NTA)) film. The latter was then modified by the coordination of Cu2+ ions onto the chelating NTA centers followed by the immobilization of the ssHIV-DNA previously modified by a polyhistidine tag by affinity binding. The immobilization of the DNA probe and hybridization with the complementary target ssHIV-DNA were investigated using fluorescence microscopy and quantified with quartz crystal microbalance experiments leading to DNA probe and duplex coverage of 1.7 × 10-11 and 7.7 × 10 -12 mol cm-2, respectively. The duplex formation was corroborated by amperometric measurements through the duplex labeling by a glucose oxidase. In the presence of hydroquinone as redox indicator, the DNA sensor was applied to the impedimetric detection of target DNA without a labeling step. A linear quantification of the HIV DNA target was carried out in the range 10-15 to 10-8 mol L-1. © 2010 American Chemical Society.}

      \field{abstract}{Chemosensory protein based olfactory biosensors are expected to play a significant role in next-generation volatile organic compound (VOC) detection systems due to their ultra-high sensitivity and selectivity. As these biosensors can perform most efficiently in aqueous environments, the detection systems need to incorporate a gas sampling interface for gas-to-liquid extraction. This interface should extract the VOCs from the gas phase with high efficiency and transfer them into the liquid containing biosensors to enable subsequent detection. To design such a transfer interface, an understanding of the key parameters influencing the gas-to-liquid extraction efficiency of target VOCs is crucial. This paper reports a gas sampling interface system based on a microfluidic open-channel device for gas-to-liquid extraction. By using this device as a model platform, the key parameters dictating the VOC extraction efficiency were identified. When loaded with 30 μL of capture liquid, the microfluidic device generates a gas-liquid interface area of 3 cm2 without using an interfacial membrane. The pumpless operation based on capillary flow was demonstrated for capture liquid loading and collection. Gas samples spiked with lipophilic model volatiles (hexanal and allyl methyl sulfide) were used for characterization of the VOC extraction efficiency. Decreasing the sampling temperature to 15 °C had a significant impact on increasing capture efficiency, while variation in the gas sampling flow rate had no significant impact in the range between 40-120 mL min-1. This study found more than a 10-fold increase in capture efficiency by chemical modification of the capture liquid with alpha-cyclodextrin. The highest capture efficiency of 30\% was demonstrated with gas samples spiked with hexanal to a concentration of 16 ppm (molar proportion). The approach in this study should be useful for further optimisation of miniaturised gas-to-liquid extraction systems and contribute to the design of chemosensory protein-based VOC detection systems.}

      \field{abstract}{The binding pockets of odorant binding proteins from Anopheles gambiae (OBP1 and OBP47) were analysed using in silico modelling. The feasibility of creating mutant proteins to achieve a protein array capable of detecting drugs of abuse in solution or in vapour phase was investigated. OBP1 was found to be easily adapted and several mutant proteins were expressed and characterised. AgamOBP1_S82P was found to have high affinities to cannabinol, 3,4-methylenedioxy methamphetamine (MDMA/Ecstasy) and cocaine hydrochloride. When these proteins were immobilised on a quartz crystal microbalance, saturated cocaine hydrochloride vapour could be detected. The sensors were stable over a period of at least 10 months in air. The approach taken allows flexible design of new biosensors based on inherently stable protein scaffolds taking advantage of the tertiary structure of odorant binding proteins.}

      \field{abstract}{Various attempts have been made to mimic the human olfactory system using human olfactory receptors (hORs). In particular, OR-expressed cell-based odorant detection systems mimic the smell sensing mechanism of humans, as they exploit endogenous cellular signaling pathways. However, the majority of such cell-based studies have been performed in the liquid phase to maintain cell viability, and liquid odorants were used as detection targets. Here, we present a microfluidic device for the detection of gaseous odorants which more closely mimics the human olfactory system. Cells expressing hOR were cultured on a porous membrane. The membrane was then flipped over and placed between two compartments. The upper compartment is the gaseous part where gaseous odorants are supplied, while the lower compartment is the aqueous part where viable cells are maintained in the liquid medium. Using this simple microfluidic device, we were able to detect gaseous odorant molecules by a fluorescence signal. The fluorescence signal was generated by calcium influx resulting from the interaction between odorant molecules and the hOR. The system allowed detection of gaseous odorant molecules in real-time, and the findings showed that the fluorescence responses increased dose-dependently in the range of 0-2. ppm odorant. In addition, the system can discriminate among gaseous odorant molecules. This microfluidic system closely mimics the human olfactory system in the sense that the submerged cells detect gaseous odorants.}

      \field{abstract}{The paper presents the experimental results on temperature dependences of electrical resistance of disordered single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) films on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates and discusses the piezoresistive effect studied in the films within the strain ranging from –0.15\% to +0.15\%. The nanotubes were prepared by catalytic disproportionation of carbon monoxide on Fe particles obtained by ferrocene vapor decomposition. SWNT films were prepared by their in situ deposition on silicon substrates and transferred to PET substrates. Electron transport properties were studied from room temperature down to 77.4 K. It is shown that the experimental data are described by the fluctuation-induced tunneling conduction model. The effective activation energy estimated by approximating experimental data varies from 175 meV to 6.5 meV for the samples with the time of nanotube deposition varying from 5 min to 120 min, respectively. The strain gauge factor measured in the film with the smallest sheet electrical resistance appeared to be negative and equal to –14.}

      \field{abstract}{As one of the most emerging next-generation nonvolatile memories, one-transistor (1T)-type nonvolatile memories are of great attention due to their excellent memory performance and simple device architecture suitable for high density memory arrays. In particular, organic 1T-type memories containing both organic semiconductors and insulators are further beneficial because of their mechanical flexibility with low cost fabrication. Here, we demonstrate a new flexible organic 1T-type memory operating at low voltage. The low voltage operation of a memory less than 10 V was obtained by employing a polymer gate insulator solution blended with ionic liquid as a charge storage layer. Ionic liquid homogeneously dissolved in a thin poly(vinylidene fluoride-cotrifluoroethylene) (PVDF-TrFE) film gave rise to low voltage operation of a device due to its high capacitance. Simultaneously, stable charge trapping of either anions or cations efficiently occurred in the polymer matrix, dependent upon gate bias. Optimization of ionic liquid in PVDF-TrFE thus led to an air-stable and mechanically flexible organic 1T-type nonvolatile memory operating at programming voltage of ±7 V with large ON/OFF current margin of approximately 103, reliable time-dependent data retention of more than 104 seconds, and write/read endurance cycles of 80.

      \field{abstract}{We report a method to measure DNA hybridization potentiometrically in a manner conducive to portable or hand-held biosensors. An electrolyte-gated transistor (EGT) based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and an ion-gel serves as a transducer for surface hybridization of DNA. The key aspect of the design is the use of a floating-gate electrode functionalized with ssDNA whose potential is determined by both capacitive coupling with a primary, addressable gate electrode and the presence of adsorbed molecules. When DNA is hybridized at the floating gate, it offsets the primary gate voltage felt by the P3HT semiconductor; the offset is directly measurable and quantitatively related to the number density of dsDNA molecules. The presented sensing strategy can be readily adapted to other biomolecules of interest and integrated into a microfluidic system for field applications of biosensors.}

      \field{abstract}{We propose a low-voltage-driven graphene field-effect transistor (GFET) gas sensor that is electrochemically gated by an ionic liquid (IL). The IL-gate GFET (ILGFET) consists of a graphene channel, located between the source and drain electrodes, and an IL, which covers the channel. Gate voltage is applied to the graphene through an electric double layer of the IL. The nanometer-thick double layer enables low-voltage operation compared with solid-gate materials, such as silicon dioxide (SiO2). The ILGFET was fabricated from chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown graphene. To test the gas sensing property, the ammonia (NH3) gas response of the fabricated ILGFET was measured. In response to 9-2400 ppm NH3, the current-voltage curve shifted toward negative voltage for the range of -0.8 to 0.8 V of gate voltage. The curve shifted 0.057 V per 10-fold increase in NH3 concentration. The calculated detection limit was 130 ppb. The fabricated sensor yielded a response time of 33 s. The sensitivity and response time of the proposed sensor were similar to those of a conventional GFET with an SiO2 gate. Additionally, the IL-gate structure was capable of decreasing the operating gate voltage. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.}

      \field{abstract}{We propose a gas sensor using combination of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and ionic liquid (IL). In our research, we used IL, 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([EMIM][BF 4]) which specially absorbs CO 2 / NH 3, and polymer, polyethyleneimine (PEI) which absorbs CO 2. This IL or the mixture of IL and PEI dropped on the CNT-FET were applied as a CNT-FET IL-gate and a surface modification material of CNTs. When the IL absorbs specific gases, the ion types and concentrations change. We measured the change of CNT I-V property by applying a voltage to the IL-gate to attract the ions onto the CNT surface. © 2012 IEEE.}

      \field{abstract}{Biocompatible ionic liquids (Bio-ILs) are an eco- and bio-friendly family of ionic liquids (ILs) useful in applications ranging from the electrochemical to the biomedical fields. The most promising strategies for their synthesis involve using molecules from bio-renewable sources as a basis for both the anionic and cationic counterparts of the Bio-ILs structure. Several studies have been conducted on Bio-IL properties, including their impact on the environment and health safety. Herein, we review progress and strategies towards the synthesis of Bio-ILs and address their ecotoxicological and biological impact. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of using these compounds in a diverse range of applications, with some insights toward their use in the development of improved technologies.}

      \field{abstract}{Ionic liquids (ILs) have been receiving much attention as solvents in various areas of biochemistry because of their various beneficial properties over the volatile solvents and ILs availability in myriad variants (perhaps as many as 108) owing to the possibility of paring one cation with several anions and vice-versa as well as formulations as zwitterions. Their potential as solvents lies in their tendency to offer both directional and non-directional forces toward a solute molecule. Because of these forces, ionic liquids easily undergo intermolecular interactions with a range of polar/non-polar solutes, including biomolecules such as proteins and DNA. The interaction of genomic species in aqueous/non-aqueous states assists in unraveling their structure and functioning, which have implications in various biomedical applications. The charge density of ionic liquids renders them hydrophilic and hydrophobic, which retain intact over long-range of temperatures. Their ability in stabilizing or destabilizing the 3D-structure of a protein or the double-helical structure of DNA has been assessed superior to the water and volatile organic solvents. The aptitude of an ion in influencing the structure and stability of a native protein depends on their ranking in the Hofmeister series. However, at several instances, a reverse Hofmeister ordering of ions and specific ion-solute interaction has been observed. The capability of an ionic liquid in terms of the tendency to promote the coiling/uncoiling of DNA structure is noted to rely on the basicity, electrostatic interaction, and hydrophobicity of the ionic liquid in question. Any change in the DNA's double-helical structure reflects a change in its melting temperature (Tm), compared to a standard buffer solution. These changes in DNA structure have implications in biosensor design and targeted drug-delivery in biomedical applications. In the current review, we have attempted to highlight various aspects of ionic liquids that influence the structure and properties of proteins and DNA. In short, the review will address the issues related to the origin and strength of intermolecular interactions, the effect of structural components, their nature, and the influence of temperature, pH, and additives on them.}

      \field{abstract}{A novel study on organic solute absorption from the vapor phase is reported. The organic solutes chosen for the absorption studies include 1,4-benzodioxane, biphenyl, xanthene, and menthol. A series of imidazolium, ammonium, and guanidinium-based ionic liquids (ILs) containing several types of anions were used as absorbents. Absorption of water vapor was also studied along with the organic solutes. Absorption studies of each organic solute were performed by using a specially devised glass apparatus at 50°C. It was observed that the rate of absorption increases with time and is faster in the case of 1,4-benzodioxane (24 h). The absorption process for each organic solute with different classes of ionic liquids was studied and the results were compared with each other. Absorption values of more than 25000 ppm were observed in some ionic liquids. Distribution ratios of organic solutes in an ionic liquid and in the vapor phase were measured and the selectivity was evaluated by using the distribution ratio values. A remarkable selectivity was observed for some ionic liquids towards a specific organic solute. Importantly, it was observed that the selectivity remained constant, even though a mixture of solute was used for the absorption study. Desorption of organic vapors from ionic liquids was successfully carried out by applying a vacuum. Further, it was observed that the same ionic liquid can be repeatedly reused several times for absorption. These studies reveal that, in future, a task-specific ionic liquid can be prepared and used for specific solute capture from the vapor phase. © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA.}

      \field{abstract}{Most mammals sniff to detect odors, but little is known how the periodic inhale and exhale that make up a sniff helps to improve odor detection. In this combined experimental and theoretical study, we use fluid mechanics and machine olfaction to rationalize the benefits of sniffing at different rates. We design and build a bellows and sensor system to detect the change in current as a function of odor concentration. A fast sniff enables quick odor recognition, but too fast a sniff makes the amplitude of the signal comparable to noise. A slow sniff increases signal amplitude but delays its transmission. This trade-off may inspire the design of future devices that can actively modulate their sniffing frequency according to different odors.}

In order to design a device able to mimic the human nose, two major issues still need to be addressed regarding the complexity of olfactory coding and the extreme sensitivity of the biological system. So far, only 50 of the approximately 300-400 functioning olfactory receptors have been de-orphanized, still a long way from breaking the human olfactory code. On the other hand, the exceptional sensitivity of the human nose is based on amplification mechanisms difficult to reproduce with electronic circuits, and perhaps novel approaches are required to address this issue. Here, we review the recent literature on chemical sensing both in biological systems and artificial devices, and try to establish the state-of-the-art towards the design of an electronic nose.}

      \field{abstract}{Detection of food-borne bacteria present in the food products is critical to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Intelligent quality sensors are being developed for detecting bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella in beef. One of our research thrusts was to develop novel sensing materials sensitive to specific indicator alcohols at low concentrations. Present work focuses on developing olfactory sensors mimicking insect odorant binding protein to detect alcohols in low concentrations at room temperature. A quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) based sensor in conjunction with synthetic peptide was developed to detect volatile organic compounds indicative to Salmonella contamination in packaged beef. The peptide sequence used as sensing materials was derived from the amino acids sequence of Drosophila odorant binding protein, LUSH. The sensors were used to detect alcohols: 3-methyl-1-butanol and 1-hexanol. The sensors were sensitive to alcohols with estimated lower detection limits of <5. ppm. Thus, the LUSH-derived QCM sensors exhibited potential to detect alcohols at low ppm concentrations. © 2011.}

      \field{abstract}{A sniff in humans typically lasts one to three seconds and is commonly considered to produce a long-exposure shot of the chemical environment that sets the temporal limit of olfactory perception. To break this limit, we devised a sniff-triggered apparatus that controls odorant deliveries within a sniff with a precision of 18 milliseconds. Using this apparatus, we show through rigorous psychophysical testing of 229 participants (649 sessions) that two odorants presented in one order and its reverse become perceptually discriminable when the stimulus onset asynchrony is merely 60 milliseconds (Cohen’s d = 0.48; 95\% confidence interval, (55, 59); 120-millisecond difference). Discrimination performance improves with the length of stimulus onset asynchrony and is independent of explicit knowledge of the temporal order of odorants or the relative amount of odorant molecules accumulated in a sniff. Our findings demonstrate that human olfactory perception is sensitive to chemical dynamics within a single sniff and provide behavioural evidence for a temporal code of odour identity.}
