The ability to detect volatile organic compounds in a highly sensitive and selective manner is desirable for applications as varied as diagnosis of illnesses at a remote clinic, monitoring of air in an industrial setting, or identification of invasive organisms at a biosecurity checkpoint. Historically, animal noses have been used for such tasks, as their combined sensitivity and selectivity are greatly superior to traditional artificial sensors. However, training and deploying animals in such situations is both time and cost intensive. In recent years, an improved understanding of \textit{in vivo} biological sensing has led to efforts to mimic these highly efficient processes in an artificial sensor format. \\[5pt] To this end, a “bioelectronic nose” was developed. This sensor uses an artificial transducer to amplify responses of an insect olfactory system to specific volatile compounds. Thin-film transistors were used as the amplifier element, given their low cost, small size and extreme sensitivity. Various thin-film morphologies were compared, and their suitability for bioelectronic nose development assessed. Transducers made using a novel steam-assisted thin-film deposition technique were found to have highly consistent device-to-device electrical properties relative to other films. Films made using this process typically showed more surface contamination than other morphologies, but their high sensitivity was nonetheless confirmed with a non-specific sensing series in an aqueous environment. \\[5pt] One of the major challenges encountered in this thesis was variability in the quality of sensor functionalisation. Raman spectroscopy and fluorescence microscopy confirmed an existing non-covalent attachment method could successfully immobilise nanodiscs onto the transistor channel region. However, various sensors functionalised using the same procedure often exhibited no sensing activity. Extensive electrical characterisation indicated the presence of an unidentified contamination layer preventing electrical interaction between the insect odorant receptors and transducer thin-film. It was shown that this layer was unlikely to be directly associated with the thin-film morphology used for the transducer. \\[5pt] Subsequently, an alternative biotin-based non-covalent method which eliminated several possible contamination sources was trialled. This alternative biotin-based method was used to demonstrate successful aqueous sensing of femtomolar concentrations of methyl salicylate by an iOR10a-functionalised device. When tested in a custom-built vapour delivery system, a similar bioelectronic sensor was shown to be highly sensitive to the target vapour. However, consistent reproduction of the biotin-based method was challenging due to the invasive cleaning method involved. It was therefore difficult to determine conclusively whether sensor responses were selective. By finding new, systematic approaches to address the major barriers to sensor success carefully identified in this work, there are promising signs that a highly reliable vapour-phase bioelectronic nose can be produced.

I chose to start my doctoral studies just a few months into a global pandemic. Completing a challenging project with a worldwide crisis in the background might have been impossible without the supervision of AProf. Natalie Plank. Her ability to adapt to and overcome any problem has taught me that there is no situation which is truly unmanageable. I am deeply grateful for her leadership throughout a time of particular chaos. \\[5pt] I started this project with minimal formal training in biological science, coming from a primarily physics and engineering background.

The immense support I received from Melissa Jordan and Colm Carraher from the Institute for Plant and Food Research (PFR) to complete this project meant that this was not an issue, and I thank them both immensely for this. \\[5pt] I would not have been able to begin this thesis without the financial backing and support I received from PFR and the Better Border Biosecurity (B3) programme. In particular, I am very grateful to Andrew Kralicek, formerly with PFR and now at Scentian Bio, and the ex-Director of B3, David Teulon, for helping to secure funding for my project. I would also like to thank the donor of the Ernest Marsden Scholarship in Physics for their significant financial support. \\[5pt] There are many incredibly supportive people who I worked alongside during my project. I would like to start off by thanking Rifat Ullah, whose mentoring and kindness encouraged me to pursue further study. His work on the initial design and setup of the vapour delivery system was invaluable to me throughout this project. I am also especially grateful to Alex Puglisi, for constructing the mechanical elements of the vapour delivery system and giving me extensive feedback on the system design. I would like to thank Peter Coard, for his advice and guidance when constructing the electrical elements of the vapour delivery system. I would also like to thank Selvan Murugathas for his advice on constructing the insect odorant receptor sensors, as well as Damon Colbert and Valentina Lucarelli, who provided the insect odorant receptor nanodiscs used in this work. \\[5pt] Thank you to AProf. Ben Ruck, my supportive secondary supervisor, and to AProf. Franck Natali, for always asking about my thesis in the tearoom.
