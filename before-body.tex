The ability to detect volatile organic compounds in a highly sensitive and selective manner is desirable for applications as varied as diagnosis of illnesses at a remote clinic, monitoring of air in an industrial setting, or identification of invasive organisms at a biosecurity checkpoint. Historically, animal noses have been used for such tasks, as their combined sensitivity and selectivity are far superior to traditional artificial sensors. However, training and deploying animals in such situations is both time and cost intensive. In recent years, an improved understanding of in vivo biological sensing has led to efforts to mimic these highly efficient processes in an artificial sensor format. To this end, a ‘bioelectronic nose’ was developed in this thesis, which uses an artificial transducer to amplify responses of an insect olfactory system to specific volatile compounds. Graphene and carbon nanotube field-effect transistors were selected as appropriate candidates for the amplifier element, given their low cost, small size and extreme sensitivity. \\[5pt] Various transducer thin-film morphologies were compared, and their suitability for bioelectronic nose development subsequently assessed. Transducers made using a novel steam-assisted deposition technique were found to have highly consistent device-to-device electrical properties relative to other platforms. Although they appeared more prone to surface contamination than comparable devices, their high sensitivity was confirmed with a non-specific sensing series in an aqueous environment. \\[5pt] One of the major challenges encountered in this thesis was variability in the quality of sensor surface functionalisation. Raman spectroscopy and fluorescence microscopy confirmed an existing non-covalent attachment method could successfully immobilise nanodiscs in the transistor channel region. However, sensors functionalised using the same procedure frequently exhibited no sensing activity. Extensive electrical characterisation indicated the presence of an unidentified contamination layer preventing electrical interaction between the insect odorant receptors and transducer thin film. Subsequently, an alternative biotin-based non-covalent method which eliminated several possible contamination sources was trialled. This alternative biotin-based method was used to demonstrate successful aqueous sensing of femtomolar concentrations of methyl salicylate by an iOR10a-functionalised device. \\[5pt] When tested in a custom-built vapour delivery system, a similar bioelectronic sensor was shown to be highly sensitive to the target vapour. However, consistent reproduction of the biotin-based method was challenging due to the invasive cleaning method involved. It was therefore difficult to determine conclusively whether sensor responses were selective. By finding new, systematic approaches to address the major barriers to sensor success carefully identified in this work, there are promising signs for the production of a highly reliable vapour-phase bioelectronic nose.

I first acknowledge the land: the land of my ancestors, and the land of the first peoples to which my ancestors travelled. Knowledge cannot exist without people, and people cannot exist without a home.\\[5pt]
I chose to start my doctoral studies just a few months into a global pandemic. Completing a challenging project with a worldwide crisis in the background might have been impossible without the supervision of AProf. Natalie Plank. Her ability to adapt to and overcome any problem has taught me that there is no situation which is truly unmanageable. I am deeply grateful for her leadership throughout a time of mass chaos. \\[5pt] I started this project with minimal formal training in biological science, coming from a primarily physics and engineering background. The immense support I received from Dr Melissa Jordan and Dr Colm Carraher from Plant and Food Research to complete this project meant that this was not an issue, and I thank them both immensely for this. \\[5pt] I would not have been able to begin this thesis without the financial backing and support I received from the Institute for Plant and Food Research, in association with the Better Border Biosecurity (B3) programme. In particular, I would like to thank the ex-Director of B3, Dr David Teulon. I would also like to thank the donor of the Ernest Marsden Scholarship in Physics for their significant financial support during my project. \\[5pt] There are many incredibly supportive people who I worked alongside at Te Herenga Waka – Victoria University of Wellington. I would like to start off by thanking Dr Rifat Ullah, whose mentoring and kindness encouraged me to pursue further study. His work on the initial design and setup of the vapour delivery system was invaluable to me throughout this project. I am also especially grateful to Alex Puglisi, for constructing the mechanical elements of the vapour delivery system and giving me extensive feedback on the system design. I would like to thank Peter Coard, for his advice and guidance when constructing the electrical elements of the vapour delivery system. Thank you to AProf. Ben Ruck, my supportive secondary supervisor, and to AProf. Franck Natali, for always asking about my thesis in the tearoom. Thank you to Dr. Gideon Gouws for his friendly encouragement and advice. I would also like to thank Alan Rennie, Grant Franklin, Chris Lepper, Rashika Gunasekara and Pete Jebson for their substantial technical assistance with this project. \\[5pt] I was lucky enough to start my doctoral program just as a group of supportive and talented senior students were finishing, and finished just as a group of enthusiastic and talented new doctoral students were starting. A special thanks to Jenna Nyugen, Erica Happe and Erica Cassie for teaching me the fabrication processes and characterisation procedures that made this thesis happen; and a special thanks to Marissa Dierkes, Danica Fontein, Sangar Begzaad and Alireza Zare, for their incredible support throughout the thesis writing process. \\[5pt] I would like to thank everyone else I shared an office with and worked alongside, including Jackson, Will, Ali, Kira, Catherine, Janani, Ted, Kiri and Joe. I would also like to thank all the interns and summer students who contributed to this project. \\[5pt] A massive thank you to Openstar Technologies. It was an honour to work on a cutting-edge plasma physics project right here in Wellington. A particularly big thank you to Thomas, Darren, Ben and Ratu for having me as part of the team. I sincerely hope to see fusion with net energy gain in Aotearoa New Zealand within the next few years. \\[5pt] I want to thank Shodokan Aikido New Zealand for their support throughout this thesis, in particular for the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to travel to Osaka, Japan to be graded for my first dan by Nariyama Shihan. Thanks for all the training and support, Ian. Thank you to all the friends, old and new, and whānau, blood-related or not, who have supported me over these wild past few years. You know who you are. \\[5pt] Thank you to my brother, Keeson, and to my parents, Hilary and Phillip. Your support means everything to me, and I would not be where I am today without you. In particular, our Friday lunchtime cafe visits have kept me inspired and motivated me throughout the doctoral program. Thank you, thank you, thank you for your love, your compassion, and for being there for me. \\[5pt] Finally, thank you Nina. Your love has kept me going through the most difficult and most wonderful times over the last three and a half years. You are the light of my life, and I am so happy to have taken on this challenge with you by my side. \\[5pt] Arohanui and peace to you all, Eddyn (Ned)
