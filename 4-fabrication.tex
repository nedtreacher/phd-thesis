\section{Fabrication of Carbon Nanotube Network and Graphene
Field-Effect Transistors}\label{sec-fabrication}}

This chapter discusses the fabrication processes for both the carbon
nanotube network and graphene transistors. Experimental optimisation of
the transducer element is critical for biosensor work, and large numbers
of transducers were required for testing various biosensor
functionalisation processes. Therefore, these processes were developed
to rapidly fabricate devices with reproducible device characteristics
appropriate for biosensing work. Also outlined in this chapter are the
characterisation techniques taken to test the quality and
reproducibility of these fabrication processes.

The nitrogen (\(\geq\) 99.99\%) and oxygen (99.7\%) used in fabrication
work was supplied by BOC Limited New Zealand. All acetone and
isopropanol used for wafer/device processing had a minimum 99.9\% purity
(HPLC grade). Deionised (DI) water was taken from a
Synergy\(^\circledR\) UV Water Purification System. The DI water had a
measured conductivity of
\((1.4\pm0.1)\textrm{ } \mu \textrm{S cm}^{-1}\), compared to tap water
with a measured conductivity of
\((7.8\pm0.2)\textrm{ } \mu \textrm{S cm}^{-1}\).

\hypertarget{sec-dep-carbon-nanotubes}{%
\subsection{Deposition of Carbon
Nanotubes}\label{sec-dep-carbon-nanotubes}}

4-inch \(p\)-type (B-doped) silicon wafers with either a 100 nm or 300
nm SiO\(_2\) layer (WaferPro LLC) were used as the substrate for carbon
nanotube network deposition. Devices intended for backgated measurements
were fabricated with a 100 nm SiO\(_2\) layer. Before deposition of
carbon nanotubes, the wafers were spin-coated with AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518
photoresist, placed photoresist-side down onto a cleanroom wipe, fixed
in place using vacuum suction, then cleaved into quarters using a
diamond-tipped scribe tool.

For fabrication performed before June 2023, the protective photoresist
layer was then removed by soaking the quarter-wafers in acetone for 15
minutes, then rinsed with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and dried with N\(_2\)
gas. However, for complete removal of photoresist, we found it was
necessary to flood expose the wafer with the Karl Suss Aligner for 1 min
and then place it in AZ326 developer for 3 min, as discussed further in
\textbf{?@sec-photoresist-contamination}.

Carbon nanotubes were deposited before alignment markers
photolithography on all wafers fabricated between Aug \(2021-\)Feb 2023,
while devices fabricated before Aug 2021 and after Feb 2023 had
alignment markers photolithography performed before the deposition of
carbon nanotubes. The process order was first switched in Aug 2021 as
this order led to faster processing times. However, the order was
switched back in Feb 2023 to minimise the exposure of carbon nanotubes
to photolithographic chemical processes.

\hypertarget{solvent-based}{%
\subsubsection{Solvent-Based}\label{solvent-based}}

The solvent-based deposition process for the carbon nanotube network in
the second fabrication protocol is as follows. 10 mg of
2-mercaptopyridine (99\%, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 1 ml ethanol
by sonication until clear. Quarter wafers were sonicated in acetone for
3 min, then exposed to O\(_2\) plasma at 100 W for at least 2 min in a
small plasma cleaner (Plasma Etch, Inc., PE-50 Compact Benchtop Plasma
Cleaning System) or reactive ion etcher (Oxford Instruments,
Plasmalab\(^\circledR\) 80 Plus) under 300 mTorr pressure. The cleaned
SiO\(_2\)/Si surface was then coated with 2-mercaptopyridine for 10
minutes, rinsed with ethanol to remove residual \(2\)-mercaptopyridine,
and then nitrogen dried.

Meanwhile, 5 \(\mu\) g of 99\% semiconducting carbon nanotube bucky
paper (NanoIntegris, IsoNanotubes S-99) was dispersed in 10 mL of
anhydrous 1,2-dichlorobenzene (Sigma Aldrich) by ultrasonication until
no particles were visible to the naked eye. During this time, the
ultrasonic bath temperature was kept between \(20-30\) \(^\circ\)C or
the buckypaper would not disperse successfully. The substrates were then
placed into a dish with CNT-DCB suspension and left covered for 1 hour,
dipped into ethanol for 10 min to remove residual solvent and any
unattached carbon nanotube bundles, and then dried with nitrogen.

\hypertarget{surfactant-based}{%
\subsubsection{Surfactant-Based}\label{surfactant-based}}

Two different approaches were used to attach the surfactant-dispersed
CNTs. The composition of the surfactant used in the dispersion is
proprietary to NanoIntegris. In both approaches, the quarter wafers were
rinsed with ultrapure deionised water (DI water), acetone and IPA before
being placed into a reactive ion etcher (Oxford Instruments, Plasmalab
80 Plus) and exposed to O\(_2\) plasma at 100 W for at least 2 min in a
small plasma cleaner (Plasma Etch, Inc, PE-50 Compact Benchtop Plasma
Cleaning System) or reactive ion etcher (Oxford Instruments, Plasmalab
80 Plus) under 300 mTorr pressure to make the surface hydrophilic. 1 mL
of poly-L-lysine (PLL) was immediately deposited onto each quarter wafer
and left for 5 minutes. The quarter wafers were then rinsed for 30 s
with DI water and dried with N\(_2\) gas. This process allows for the
surface adhesion of semiconducting single carbon nanotubes suspended in
surfactant.

\hypertarget{simple-dropcasting}{%
\paragraph*{Simple Dropcasting}\label{simple-dropcasting}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Simple Dropcasting}

2 mL of IsoNanotubes-S 90\% or 99\% solution (NanoIntegris) was decanted
into a small bottle and sonicated for 5 s to break up bundles of CNTs.
An even spread of 400 \(\mu\)L CNT solution was placed in the centre of
the PLL-functionalised quarter wafer, covered and left for 10 minutes.
The CNT solution was then rinsed off with DI water and IPA, and then the
quarter wafer was dried with N\(_2\) gas. Next, the quarter wafer was
annealed in a vacuum oven at 150\(^\circ\) C for 1 hour to remove
residual surfactant. This method would often lead to an inhomogeneous
spread of CNTs across the quarter wafer surface, detailed further in
section \textbf{?@sec-cnt-deposition-effects}.

\end{figure}

2 mL of IsoNanotubes-S 90\% or 99\% solution (NanoIntegris) was decanted
into a small bottle and burst-sonicated once (on then off again) to
break up bundles of CNTs. 75 mL of 95\(^\circ\) C water was then placed
into a glass dish on a hotplate held at 95\(^\circ\) C. After this, the
PLL-functionalised quarter wafer was placed in the centre of an
insulating surface on the same hotplate. The CNT dispersion was
carefully spread across the surface of the wafer without spilling any
over the wafer edges. The wafer on the insulating surface and glass dish
were then left under the same cover for 2 minutes to expose the wafer to
steam from the glass dish. The use of an insulating surface meant that
the wafer and CNT dispersion were not heated from below while exposed to
steam. The steam-assisted deposition setup is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-steaming-method}.

The CNT dispersion was then rinsed off the wafer with DI water, ethanol,
acetone and IPA, and then the quarter wafer was dried with N\(_2\) gas.
As in the original method, the quarter wafer was then annealed in a
vacuum oven at 150\(^\circ\) C for 1 hour to remove residual surfactant.
This method gave an even spread of CNTs across the quarter wafer
surface, leading to a greater consistency in performance between
devices. Further details can be found in
\textbf{?@sec-cnt-deposition-effects}.

\caption{\label{fig-qw-photolithography}The photolithographic processes
used for fabrication of both carbon nanotube and graphene devices
(graphene devices were fabricated individually for every step, step \#2
skipped for graphene devices)}

\end{figure}

Photolithography was used to define eight channel regions on each device
and subsequently to define metal contacts for each of these channels. A
schematic demonstrating these photolithography processes on a quarter
wafer is shown in Figure~\ref{fig-qw-photolithography}. Masks for
photolithography were designed in-house using LayoutEditor CAD software
and patterned externally with a UV laser writer.

Thermal evaporation was used when depositing chromium (Cr-plated
tungsten rods, Kurt J. Lesker) and gold (Au wire, 99.99\%, Regal
Castings Ltd.), while electron beam evaporation was used when depositing
titanium (Ti pieces, 99.99\%, Kurt J. Lesker) and metal oxides
(\emph{e.g.} Al\(_2\)O\(_3\) pieces, 99.99\%, Kurt J. Lesker). Metal and
metal oxide deposition was performed using an Angstrom Engineering
Nexdep 200 Vacuum Deposition System. Deposition thickness was controlled
using an Inficon Deposition Controller and electron beam power was
provided by a Telemark TT-6 power supply. For metals, the chamber was
initially evacuated to a pressure \(5 \times 10^{-6}\) mTorr, while for
metal oxides the chamber was initially evacuated to a pressure of
\(1 \times 10^{-5}\) mTorr. After evaporation, the chamber was cooled
and vented with nitrogen.

Carbon nanotube devices were fabricated using the quarter wafer
substrates discussed in Section~\ref{sec-dep-carbon-nanotubes}.

Graphene devices were fabricated using 300 nm SiO\(_2\)/p-type Si
substrates covered with a monolayer of mechanically transferred CVD
graphene (Advanced Chemical Supplier). This substrate was cleaved into
equal-sized square chips before photolithography, with side length
between \(11.6-11.7\) mm, subject to variability in wafer size. The same
cleaving process outlined in Section~\ref{sec-dep-carbon-nanotubes} was
used for cleaving the chips, but the photoresist was not rinsed off
after cleaving. Devices were exposed to a brief burst of N\(_2\) gas to
remove any dust from the cleaving process from the surface of devices.
When not being used in photolithography, devices were stored in a vacuum
desiccator to prevent the quality of the graphene deteriorating with
exposure to air over time.

\caption{\label{fig-dmso-damage}Lift-off with dimethyl sulfoxide

\end{figure}

Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was sometimes used in lift-off processes
instead of acetone between Jul 2021 and Feb 2023 because of its
effectiveness as a photoresist stripping agent. However, it was
abandoned due to some indications it was too aggressive for the devices
being fabricated, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig-dmso-damage} and also as
detailed in \textbf{?@sec-cnt-deposition-effects}. It is possible that
heat from the electrodes deposition sometimes crosslinked residual
photoresist on the nanomaterial, and then during lift-off was removed
aggressively together with any attached nanomaterial by the DMSO.
However, it is also possible that prolonged exposure to DMSO alone was
sufficient to detach nanomaterial from the substrate. Therefore, acetone
was the preferred agent for lift-off despite being a less efficient
stripping agent than DMSO.

From Jul 2023 onwards, after each photolithography step using negative
resist, quarter wafers/chips placed in AZ326 or SU8 developer for 3 min
to ensure complete removal of photoresist residue. For each step with
positive resist, the same procedure was performed but with a flood
exposure with UV light for 1 min before being placed in developer. The
exception to this rule was for devices with an aluminium oxide layer
present. Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH), the active ingredient of
AZ\(^\circledR\) 326, etches through aluminium oxide and causes
electrical shorts through the dielectric layer {[}@Oh2011; @Ali2021{]}.
A further discussion showing the results of this process is given in
\textbf{?@sec-photoresist-contamination}.

\hypertarget{sec-align}{%
\subsubsection{Alignment Markers}\label{sec-align}}

Metal alignment markers were deposited in order to accurately align the
device channels with device electrodes in subsequent photolithography
steps. These alignment markers were asymmetric to indicate the
orientation of the device for subsequent photolithography steps and
electrical characterisation. In later discussion, channel 1 is defined
as the channel placed closest to the large, double square alignment
marker.

For carbon nanotube quarter wafers, alignment markers were deposited
either directly before or after carbon nanotube deposition (see
Section~\ref{sec-dep-carbon-nanotubes} for discussion). For graphene
devices, alignment markers were deposited directly after cleaving using
the protective photoresist layer spincoated prior to cleaving.
AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518 was used for alignment marker photolithography.

For carbon nanotube devices made before Jun 2022, chromium was used as
an adhesive layer for gold, while for all graphene devices and carbon
nanotube devices made after Jun 2022, titanium was used as the adhesive
layer. For chromium/gold depositions, a nominal 10 nm of chromium was
deposited followed by a nominal 100 nm Au layer. For titanium/gold
depositions, a nominal \(10-20\) nm of titanium was deposited followed
by a nominal 50 nm Au layer (for independent measurements of metal layer
thickness, see Section~\ref{sec-electrodes}). Devices were then soaked
in acetone for at least 2 hours for photoresist lift-off, washed in IPA
and dried with nitrogen. The use of titanium gave rise to a cleaner
lift-off and improved gold adhesion. Using a relatively thin gold layer
(50 nm nominal instead of 100 nm) proved to still be clearly visible but
to a cleaner lift-off.

\hypertarget{channel-etching}{%
\subsubsection{Channel Etching}\label{channel-etching}}

Eight channel features, each 1000 \(\mu\)m in length and 100 \(\mu\)m in
width with a pitch of 1200 \(\mu\)m, were patterned using
AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518 photolithography on each carbon nanotube or
graphene-covered substrate. Unwanted nanomaterial not covered with
photoresist was then etched away with 200 W oxygen plasma at 600 mTorr
using a reactive ion etcher or RIE (Plasmalab\(^\circledR\) 80 Plus,
Oxford Instruments). The etch time was 3 minutes for carbon nanotube
quarter wafers, and 1 minute for graphene chips. The protective
photoresist was then removed by soaking in acetone for at least 5
minutes.

between the source and drain electrodes across a channel from various
quarter wafers with electrodes deposited using different approaches. For
each quarter wafer, the profiles of three different channels are shown,
selected from different locations across the quarter wafer surface.}

\end{figure}

The source and drain electrodes for each channel were patterned using
photolithography with either AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518 photoresist (pre-Mar
2023) or AZ\(^\circledR\) nLOF 2020 photoresist (post-Mar 2023). Before
metal deposition, the developed photoresist pattern was exposed to
O\(_2\) plasma at 50 W for up to 5 s or at 20 W for \(20-25\) s in a
PE-50 plasma cleaner (Plasma Etch, Inc.) to remove residual photoresist
on the developed regions and ensure a clean lift-off. After metal
deposition, wafers/devices were soaked in acetone for at least 2 hours
for photoresist lift-off, washed in IPA and dried with nitrogen.

As with the alignment markers deposition (see Section~\ref{sec-align}),
before Jun 2022 chromium was used for the gold adhesion layer, and after
Jun 2022 titanium was used. Adhesion layers are required to stick metals
such as gold and platinum to silicon dioxide {[}@Guarnieri2014{]}. A 20
nm nominal titanium layer instead of 10 nm nominal was found to give
better electrode adhesion, and devices after Feb 2023 were made using
this thicker adhesion layer. Good electronic contact could be made with
electrodes with a nominal gold layer thickness of \(60-100\) nm, and a
Au layer nominally 100 nm thick was most commonly used.

Example height profiles of chromium layer channels and a titanium layer
channels taken using a Veeco Dektat 150 profiler are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-dektat-adhesion-layer}. AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518
photoresist was used here for photolithographic patterning. A 10 nm
adhesion layer and 100 nm Au layer were used for both depositions to
ensure a consistent comparison. From
Figure~\ref{fig-dektat-adhesion-layer}, we find an measured Cr/Au
electrode height of \(42\pm1\) nm and an measured Ti/Au electrode height
of \(48\pm2\) nm, slightly less than half the respective heights stated
on the Inficon Deposition Controller.

Although using AZ\(^\circledR\) nLOF 2020 photolithography involves more
processing steps, it gave rise to more cleanly-defined electrodes with a
more consistent height profile. Often electrodes deposition using
AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518 photoresist would lead to sharp vertical spikes
along the edge of the electrode. These edge spikes or ``cat ears'' could
partially or fully protrude through thin encapsulation materials such as
SU8 and Al\(_2\)O\(_3\), leading to significant leakage currents from
the electrodes into the FET top gate. This effect is due to the profile
of positive resists being suboptimal for lift-off processes, as
discussed in \textbf{?@sec-photolithography}.

The height profiles corresponding to a wafer with electrodes fabricated
using AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518 and to a wafer with electrodes fabricated
using AZ\(^\circledR\) nLOF 2020 are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-dektat-photoresist-used}. A 20 nm titanium adhesion
layer and 100 nm Au layer were used for both depositions to ensure a
consistent comparison, resulting in a measured electrode height of
\(103\pm2\) nm for both wafers. The wafer which used AZ\(^\circledR\)
nLOF 2020 photoresist clearly has a more consistent electrode height
profile across the wafer surface than the wafer which used
AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518 resist. The measured edge features for the
AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518 resist electrodes vary in size from 20 nm to 450
nm above the bulk electrode surface, whereas the edge features for the
AZ\(^\circledR\) nLOF 2020 resist do not exceed 14 nm in height.

\hypertarget{sec-encapsulation}{%
\subsubsection{Encapsulation}\label{sec-encapsulation}}

Several different approaches were used for the encapsulation, or contact
protection, of devices. The encapsulation of graphene and
carbon-nanotube transistors for biosensing is essential to improve
transistor characteristics, passivate the electrodes and ensure only the
nanomaterial region is active during biosensing, as discussed in
\textbf{?@sec-biosensor-methods}.

Before encapsulation photolithography the carbon-nanotube network
quarter wafers were cleaved into individual 11 mm \(\times\) 11 mm
chips, using the cleaving process outlined in
Section~\ref{sec-dep-carbon-nanotubes}. Cleaving the devices at this
step simplified mask alignment and ensured consistent thickness across
photoresist encapsulated devices.

Two different photolithography masks were used for encapsulation
photolithography in this work, with different exposed areas of active
nanomaterial. The first mask was used for devices made before Jan 2023,
and was designed to leave a region of 500 \(\mu\)m \(\times\) 10
\(\mu\)m unencapsulated for each channel. The second mask was used
exclusively after Jan 2023, and was designed to leave a region of 200
\(\mu\)m \(\times\) 20 \(\mu\)m unencapsulated for each channel. This
change was made to double the area of carbon nanotubes exposed to
electrolyte while halving the area of SiO\(_2\) dielectric exposed to
electrolyte during aqueous sensing.

A side-by-side microscope comparison of hardbaked AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518
processed with each mask is given in
Figure~\ref{fig-microscope-encapsulation}, while a Dektat profile
comparison corresponding to Figure~\ref{fig-microscope-encapsulation} is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig-old-new-mask}. The profiles corresponding to
the mask used after Jan 2023 clearly exhibit greater device-to-device
consistency, partly due to the mask requiring a greater level of
accuracy when aligning the encapsulation pattern with the electrode
channel. The larger feature size also means development time has less of
an impact on the quality of the encapsulation opening.

\end{figure}

Two types of photoresist were initially trialled for encapsulation,
AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518 and SU8-2150. Both AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518
{[}@Thanihaichelvan2018; @Thanihaichelvan2019; @Shkodra2021{]} and SU-8
have been previously used for device encapsulation, with SU-8 noted for
being particularly stable and biocompatible {[}@Lee2006; @Chen2021;
@Albarghouthi2022{]}. Once developed, the photoresist pattern was
exposed to O\(_2\) plasma at 50 W for up to 5 s or at 20 W for \(20-25\)
s to remove excess photoresist from the encapsulation opening. Devices
were then hardbaked at 200\(^\circ\)C for 1 hour to fully crosslink the
encapsulation layer. This crosslinking ensured subsequent device
exposure to solvent did not remove the photoresist encapsulation.

The exposed region clear of AZ \(^\circledR\) 1518 resist was
\(6.8 \pm 0.3\) \(\mu\)m in width when using the old, pre-2023 mask,
while the exposed region was \(16.6 \pm 0.4\) \(\mu\)m when using
AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518 with the new mask from 2023, as seen in
Figure~\ref{fig-old-new-mask}. However, the exposed region was reduced
for the SU-8 encapsulation relative to the AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518, with
an width of only 3.6 \(\pm\) 0.5 \(\mu\)m for the pre-2023 mask, as seen
in Figure~\ref{fig-SU8-encapsulation}. Photoresist development using
SU-8 was significantly more time-sensitive than for the AZ\(^\circledR\)
1518. This meant when the development time was increased to create a
wider encapsulation opening, it was difficult to avoid removing large
areas of photoresist across the surface of the encapsulation. This meant
using the new mask from 2023 was especially important for maximising the
exposed channel region of SU-8 devices. Using the new mask from 2023
with the SU-8 resist gave a significantly improved width of 13.8 \(\pm\)
1.0 \(\mu\)m for the exposed region.

A relatively thin SU-8 encapsulation layer could be deposited when
compared to the AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518 encapsulation profile. The
AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518 encapsulation layer had a average height of 1.7
\(\pm\) 0.2 \(\mu\)m, while the SU-8 encapsulation layer had a average
height of 680 \(\pm\) 20 nm. The SU-8 also had much less significant
edge features than the AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518, regardless of the profiles
of the source and drain electrodes.

As noted previously, for both resists the overall profile was more
consistent for the new, 2023 mask from device to device than for the old
pre-2023 mask.

\end{figure}

Another approach taken was encapsulation of electrode channels with a
dielectric metal oxide/ceramic layer. A electron beam deposition process
was used to deposit a \(100-150\) nm nominal metal oxide layer on
devices patterned with the 2023 mask using AZ\(^\circledR\) nLOF 2020
photoresist. As in Section~\ref{sec-electrodes}, the developed
photoresist pattern was exposed to O\(_2\) plasma at 50 W for up to 5 s
or at 20 W for \(20-25\) s in a PE-50 plasma cleaner (Plasma Etch, Inc.)
before ceramic deposition. Before May 2023, devices were left in
TechniStrip\(^\circledR\) MLO 07 (MicroChemicals) for \(5-10\) min for
lift-off. However, due to concerns over the impact of the constituent
chemical DMSO on the nanomaterial region (see
Figure~\ref{fig-dmso-damage}), the lift-off process was altered from May
2023 onwards. After May 2023, devices were soaked in acetone for at
least 4 hours and sonicated in clean acetone for \(30-60\) s to lift-off
the photoresist, then washed in IPA and dried with nitrogen.

The initial attempt at fabricating a dielectric encapsulation layer used
silicon dioxide as the dielectric. However, silicon dioxide adheres
poorly to gold without an metallic adhesive layer present, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-dielectric-comparison}. Aluminium oxide was chosen as an
alternative as it sticks well to bulk electrode materials, is heat and
chemical resistant, has a relatively high dielectric constant and is
bio-compatible {[}@Guarnieri2014; @Albarghouthi2022; @Kolodzey2000{]}.
Figure~\ref{fig-dektat-dielectric-layer} shows the aluminium oxide
successfully adhered to the electrodes and had a clean profile
comparable to that of the SU-8 encapsulation layer after lift-off. As
noted earlier, aluminium oxide should not be subsequently exposed to its
etchant TMAH.

\hypertarget{sec-afm-characterisation}{%
\subsection{Characterisation via Atomic Force
Microscopy}\label{sec-afm-characterisation}}

Atomic force microscopy in this thesis was taken using a Nanosurf
NaioAFM in dynamic force mode. Atomic force microscope (AFM) images
could not be taken from the small exposed channel region on the
encapsulated devices, so were instead taken on a representative carbon
nanotube or graphene film sample fabricated on the same wafer as the
device being tested. Moisture adversely affected the AFM imaging
process. Therefore, films functionalised with biological materials were
washed with DI water and gently dried with N\(_2\) before atomic force
microscope images were taken. The open source data analysis software
Gwyddion (version 2.59) was used to analyse AFM images.

\hypertarget{sec-fluorescence-characterisation}{%
\subsection{Characterisation via Fluorescence
Microscopy}\label{sec-fluorescence-characterisation}}

Fluorescence microscopy was taken using an Olympus BX63 fluorescence
microscope controlled using cellSens imaging software. Microscope
objectives used were all Olympus UPLSAPO/UPlanSApo, apochromat
objectives which compensate for spherical and chromatic aberrations.
Objectives had infinite aperture and a field number of 26.5. Filter
cubes used included the Olympus FITC filter (excitation wavelength
range: \(467-498\) nm, emission wavelength range: \(513-556\) nm), Texas
Red (excitation wavelength range: \(542-582\) nm, emission wavelength
range: \(604-644\) nm) and GFP (excitation wavelength range: \(604-644\)
nm, emission wavelength range: \(502-538\) nm). The ISO was kept at the
lowest available setting, ISO200. All microscopy was performed in
darkness with the screen turned away from the microscope. To ensure
photobleaching did not adversely affect imaging, images were taken soon
after initial exposure to fluorescence and taking repeated photos of the
same region was avoided. Various useful and thourough introductions to
fluorescence microscopy can be found online {[}@Nikon; @Zeiss{]}.

to a ground plane. Drain current I\(_{\mathrm{d}}\) is measured at the
drain SMU, and gate leakage current I\(_{\mathrm{g}}\) is measured at
the gate SMU.}

\end{figure}

Both back-gated and liquid-gated measurements were taken of carbon
nanotube and graphene devices. Liquid-gated measurements were taken
using the configuration shown in Figure~\ref{fig-liquid-gate-schematic}.
Back-gated measurements were taken with a copper plane placed underneath
the Si/SiO\(_2\) wafer and connected to SMU 3 instead of the reference
electrode.

All measurement setups used had the same basic configuration, with two
source measure units (SMUs) attached to the source and gate. Voltage
from the source and gate SMUs was either kept constant or varied, with
only one SMU varied at a time. Three different measurement setups were
used for taking these measurements, the Keysight (Agilent/HP) 4156C
Semiconductor Parameter Analyser, the Keysight B1500A Semiconductor
Device Analyser, and a National Instruments NI-PXIe modular measurement
system with a 8 GB PXIe-8821 controller and two NI-4138 source measure
units. For measurements with the Keysight instruments, a third, drain
SMU was attached and kept at a constant 0 V (as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-liquid-gate-schematic}).

When using the Keysight 4156C Semiconductor Parameter Analyser or
Keysight B1500A Semiconductor Device Analyser for liquid-gated
measurements, a Rucker and Kolls with micromanipulators was used to
contact the devices; when using the National Instruments NI-PXIe for
liquid-gated measurements, a custom-made chip carrier with
spring-loaded, pointed-tip, gold-coated pogo pins was used. Ag/AgCl
standard electrodes were used as the liquid-gate electrode. The
electrode was submerged in 80 \(\mu\)L of PBS buffer in a
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) well with outer dimensions of 12 mm
\(\times\) 6 mm \(\times\) 6 mm. This PDMS well was sonicated in
isopropanol for 10 min and thoroughly N\(_2\) dried before use. The
microscope images seen in Figure~\ref{fig-PDMS-clean} show the PDMS
surface before and after this cleaning step. The end of Ag/AgCl standard
electrode to be submerged should be rinsed in DI water and left to sit
in DI water for 15 minutes before sensing is performed.

The Keysight 4156C Semiconductor Parameter Analyser and Keysight B1500A
Semiconductor Device Analyser were also used for back-gated measurements
of devices within the vapour delivery system device chamber. This
chamber acted as a Faraday cage for another custom-made chip carrier
with spring-loaded gold-coated pogo pins, able to contact four channel
electrode pairs at once.

Custom programs for National Instruments LabView 2017 were used for
measurements from the Keysight 4156C Semiconductor Parameter Analyser
and the National Instruments NI-PXIe. Keysight EasyEXPERT software was
used for characterisation with the Keysight B1500A Semiconductor Device
Analyser.

Liquid-gated transfer characteristics of carbon nanotube FETs were
measured at V\(_{\mathrm{ds}}\) = 100 mV and liquid-gated transfer
characteristics of graphene FETs were measured at V\(_{\mathrm{ds}}\) =
1 V, where V\(_{\mathrm{lg}}\) was swept between -0.5 V and 1 V in both
the forward and reverse direction with a step size of either 10 or 20
mV. Backgated transfer characteristics of carbon nanotube FETs were
either measured at V\(_{\mathrm{ds}}\) = 100 mV or V\(_{\mathrm{ds}}\) =
1 V, where V\(_{\mathrm{bg}}\) was swept between -5 V and 5 V in the
forward and reverse directions with a step size of 50 mV.

Sensing measurements were performed with constant source-drain and gate
voltages. The gate voltage used was chosen by locating the subthreshold
region of the device transfer characteristics and choosing a voltage
that fell within this region, usually V\(_{\mathrm{g}}\) = 0 V. The
choice of gate voltage for sensing measurements is discussed further in
\textbf{?@sec-biosensing-transducers} and \textbf{?@sec-dummy-sensing}.
Using the NI-PXIe with the PXIe-2737 module, eight-channel multiplexed
current measurements could be taken in rapid succession. An integration
time of 200 or 400 ms was used for sampling with each channel, with the
actual sampling rate set by the NI-PXIe. In practice this meant a
sampling rate of 1.81 s (for 200 ms integration time) or 3.41 s (for 400
ms integration time) for any given channel. A 200 ms integration time
meant the time between samples from successive channels varied between
\(220 ms-230\) ms, while a 400 ms integration time meant the time
between samples stayed at 426 ms. The other Keysight equipment used a 1
s sampling interval.

\hypertarget{summary}{%
\subsection{Summary}\label{summary}}

A variety of approaches were trialled when depositing a carbon nanotube
network for the fabrication of transistor devices, and the resultant
morphology of these networks are discussed in the next chapter. Standard
photolithographic methods were used to successfully fabricate carbon
nanotube and graphene field effect transistor devices. A range of
photolithography types and electrode/encapsulation materials were
trialled to find the optimal device composition for sensing, also
discussed in the next chapter. Atomic force microscopy, fluorescence
microscopy and a variety of electrical measurement setups were used to
characterise the devices.
