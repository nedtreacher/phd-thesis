\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

So far in this thesis, multiple design schemes have been described for
the construction of biosensors with insect odorant receptors. In
\textbf{?@sec-fabrication}, transducers were fabricated and
characterised which used either graphene or various carbon nanotube
network morphologies for the conductive channel. These morphologies
included highly bundled networks from dropcasting in an organic
solution, and less bundled networks dropcast in surfactant solution
either with or without steam present. Functionalisation approaches using
the attachment linkers PBASE, PBA/EDC, pyrene-NTA and pyrene-biotin were
discussed in \textbf{?@sec-noncovalent-functionalisation}, where linker
functionalisation was investigated using electrical, spectroscopic and
optical analysis techniques, including Raman spectroscopy and
fluorescence microscopy. This investigation included a comparison of
positive and negative aspects of each approach for their application in
an iOR biosensor setting. The next step in the process was to integrate
these components into a biosensor for testing in the redesigned vapour
delivery system, as described in
\textbf{?@sec-vapour-sensing-biosensors}. In the vapour delivery system,
signal responses can be compared to those measured by the non-selective
onboard reference sensors. However, it was important to first ensure the
functionalised devices worked consistently as biosensors in the existing
aqueous sensing setup, as described in
\textbf{?@sec-pristine-characteristics}.

In the following chapter, aqueous sensing with insect odorant receptors
was achieved with two different sensor functionalisation approaches, one
where linker was attached to the transducer in organic solvent, and one
where linker was preattached to odorant receptors and the process was
performed entirely in aqueous solution. The first approach was more
similar to those used previously for insect odorant receptor
functionalisation \autocite{Murugathas2019b,Murugathas2020}, but was not
reproducible in a manner consistent enough for reliable testing with the
vapour delivery system. A range of slight changes to this organic
solvent functionalisation procedure were trialled to identify the source
of the inconsistency in biosensor behaviour. The testing indicated that
either surface coatings present on the device channels or the protective
structure of the nanodiscs used were causing the quality of
functionalisation to vary. The second approach, which eliminates both
surface coatings and the nanodisc format, was therefore tested in the
vapour delivery system. However, little response was shown by the
functionalised sensor to the positive analyte. Finally, possible reasons
for this lack of response are discussed.

A carbon nanotube network field-effect transistor device, fabricated
using post-June 2023 methods as described in \textbf{?@sec-fabrication},
was functionalised with OR22a nanodiscs. The network used for the device
was deposited using the steam-assisted surfactant method, and the device
was encapsulated with AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518 using the post-Jan 2023
photolithography mask. The functionalisation was performed as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The device was exposed to UV light for 1 minute, placed in
  AZ\(^\circledR\) 326 developer for 3 minutes, then rinsed with
  acetone, isopropanol and nitrogen dried.
\item
  The device was vacuum annealed for 1 hour at 150°C.
\end{enumerate}

Note: Steps 1 \& 2 were added to ensure any residual photoresist on the
channel was removed or passivated before functionalisation, see
\textbf{?@sec-photoresist-contamination}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  A solution of 1 mM PBASE (Setareh Biotech) in methanol was prepared by
  fully dissolving 2 mg PBASE in 5 mL methanol by vortex mixing at 1000
  rpm in a dark room.
\end{enumerate}

Note: PBASE was stored at -18°C for 18 months prior to use, and was
thawed under vacuum for 15 minutes in dark conditions before opening.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\item
  The device was then rinsed with methanol, fully submerged in \(\sim\)
  1 mL of PBASE in methanol solution and left covered with parafilm for
  1 hour, then rinsed with methanol for 15 s, rinsed with \(1 \times\)
  PBS for 15 s and nitrogen dried to remove residual PBASE.
\item
  The device was left dry and in darkness while collecting the OR22a
  nanodiscs from the -80°C freezer.
\item
  10 µL OR22a nanodiscs (batch number ND-OR22a-SB018, 1.9 mg/mL,
  prepared 7 months earlier) were diluted in 1 mL freshly-prepared
  \(1 \times\) PBS.
\end{enumerate}

Note: The full 1 mL was used to flush out the nanodisc vial when
preparing the nanodisc solution, with successive additions and
subtractions of 50 µL \(1 \times\) PBS into and from the vial.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{6}
\tightlist
\item
  The device was submerged in the OR22a nanodisc solution and left
  covered with parafilm for 1 hour, then rinsed with \(1 \times\) PBS
  for 15 s and gently nitrogen dried.
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

The liquid-gated electrical characteristics shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-OR22a-TX-comparison} were taken using the B1500A
semiconductor device analyser of the sensing channel (channel 7) before
and after functionalisation with OR22a nanodiscs. The liquid-gate buffer
used was \(1 \times\) PBS containing 0.5\% v/v DMSO. The device
exhibited ambipolar characteristics before functionalisation, which is
typically seen for steam-deposited carbon nanotube films
(\textbf{?@sec-electrical-characterisation-CNT};
\textbf{?@sec-cnt-devices}). However, \(p\)-type behaviour dominates
after device functionalisation due to a significant drop in \(n\)-type
conductance. A slight increase in hysteresis was observed
post-functionalisation. Leakage current (shown by the dashed traces)
never exceeded \(1 \times 10^{-7}\) V, both before and after
functionalisation. The significant change in electrical characteristics
could be due to five possible factors \(-\) adsorption of solvent onto
the network, network attachment of PBASE without subsequent protein
attachment, non-specific adsorption of protein onto the network,
PBASE-mediated attachment of the membrane scaffold protein (MSP) of
nanodiscs to the network, and PBASE-mediated attachment of odorant
receptors to the network. As the nanodisc volume is much larger than
that of the odorant receptor, any direct protein adsorption most likely
adsorption of the nanodisc membrane onto the carbon nanotube network.
Odorant receptor attachment with PBASE is therefore the only desirable
functionalisation result for sensing purposes. Functionalisation of the
channel resulted in a negative shift in threshold voltage of
\(-0.20\pm0.03\) V. This significantly exceeds the threshold voltage
shifts measured for both methanol adsorption (\(-0.15\pm0.02\) V) and
device exposure to PBASE in methanol (\(-0.06\pm0.04\) V), confirming
that protein has attached to the carbon nanotubes. However, both direct
protein adsorption \autocite{Bradley2004,Heller2008,Kauffman2008} and
empty nanodisc membrane attachment \autocite{Murugathas2019b} should
also lead to a significant negative threshold voltage shift and
therefore increased \(p\)-conduction in the liquid-gated transfer
characteristic curve. In all three cases, the voltage shift is
predominantly the result of negative charge transfer from the adsorbed
proteins to the semiconducting carbon nanotubes
\autocite{Bradley2004,Heller2008,Murugathas2019b}. It is likely that the
negative shift observed results from some combination of the three types
of attachment. It should be noted that while the size of the
functionalisation-induced threshold voltage shift can be used to
determine whether an amine-tagged protein has attached to the nanodisc
network, it cannot be used to specifically determine whether odorant
receptors have attached to the network.

\end{figure}

Atomic force microscope images were taken of the device channels both
before functionalisation and after sensing with the functionalised
device to confirm the presence of nanodiscs. As far as the author knows,
these are the first atomic force microscope images taken of iOR
nanodiscs found on a sensing channel rather than on a separate carbon
nanotube film; this was made possible by using the 20 µm wide aperture
encapsulation mask discussed in \textbf{?@sec-encapsulation}. AFM images
showing iOR-nanodisc functionalised carbon nanotube networks have been
reported by Murugathas \emph{et al.}, but these images were not of
channels used for sensing \autocite{Murugathas2019b}. These images are
shown in Figure~\ref{fig-working-OR22a-AFM}. The visible features are
much smaller than the agglomerated nanodisc features in the atomic
microscope images taken by Murugathas \emph{et al.}
\autocite{Murugathas2019b}. On the dense network morphology used here,
the position of nanodisc clusters relative to the carbon nanotubes is
also less distinct. To confirm whether nanodiscs have preferentially
attached to the carbon nanotubes, a more quantitative approach is
required.

\end{figure}

Since no trough-like artifacts are visible in either the pristine or
functionalised atomic force microscope images in
Figure~\ref{fig-working-OR22a-AFM}, a value of 1.8 nm was used as the
mean substrate height for image processing. This height is shown against
each carbon nanotube network the masking tool in Gwyddion in
Figure~\ref{fig-working-OR22a-masks}. In Gwyddion, both images were then
simplified to a binary representation, where features above a certain
threshold were shown as white and features below shown as black. This
representation, shown in Figure~\ref{fig-crosssection}, has the
appearance of a cross-section through the network at the threshold
height. The threshold was chosen as the minimum height where carbon
nanotube spindles were no longer apparent in the functionalised image,
10 nm above the substrate. Figure~\ref{fig-crosssection} (a) shows only
a few, sparsely distributed features, each measuring up to 50 nm across.
These features may correspond to large nanotube-nanotube junctions,
surfactant residue, or other surface contamination
(\textbf{?@sec-pristine-morphology}). In Figure~\ref{fig-crosssection}
(b), many features are over 50 nm across. They are often found close
together, and form a curved line across the network in the bottom left
corner (shown in red); this arrangement of nanodisc features is similar
to that reported previously for OR22a nanodiscs on sparser, more bundled
networks \autocite{Murugathas2019b}.

\caption{\label{fig-crosssection}Binary representations of the atomic
force microscope images of (a) the pristine device and (b) the
functionalised device, with a threshold height of 11.8 nm (10 nm above
the average substrate height).}

\end{figure}

The maximum image height of the OR nanodisc-functionalised channel is 26
nm (Figure~\ref{fig-working-OR22a-AFM}) and only nanodisc features are
present at 12 nm (Figure~\ref{fig-crosssection}), meaning that nanodisc
agglomerates at least 14 nm tall are present on the channel. Assuming a
average carbon nanotube height of 1.45 nm, with an average substrate
height of 1.8 nm, the nanodisc agglomerates visible in
Figure~\ref{fig-working-OR22a-AFM} could be up to \(\sim\) 23 nm tall.
The estimated height range for nanodiscs is \(\sim\) 5 \(-\) 20 nm
\autocite{Nath2007,Bayburt2010,Murugathas2020,Cheema2021}. It is
possible that nanodiscs form a single layer on the carbon nanotube
network. Height measurements of biological samples taken via AFM have
been shown to underestimate actual feature height by over 50\%
\autocite{Vobornik2023}. Even so, assuming this squishing effect is not
significantly in excess of 50\%, the agglomerates are only a few
nanodiscs high at most. As the nanodisc agglomerates are up to 200 nm
across at their widest point (Figure~\ref{fig-working-OR22a-AFM}),
comprising of at least 20 nanodiscs, it appears that the clustering
behaviour is primarily across the plane rather than vertical. It appears
that, rather than nucleating in solution about a central point prior to
attachment, the nanodiscs are individually attaching to preferred
locations on the network.

This attachment behaviour can be contrasted with the behaviour observed
in the atomic microscope image of agglomerated OR22a nanodiscs taken by
Murugathas \emph{et al.} \autocite{Murugathas2019b}. The network is
significantly sparser, so the relative extent of clustering at different
points is easier to discern. There is clearly significant variation in
nanodisc attachment across a single nanotube bundle, and it appears that
clustering is more significant at junctions between carbon nanotube
bundles. Preferred attachment locations away from junctions could result
from the higher reactivity of exposed metallic CNTs \autocite{Cao2009},
or from regions which are particularly clean of contamination.
Interestingly, while the OR22a nanodisc features seen by Murugathas
\emph{et al.} via AFM are similar in breadth to those seen here, OR
agglomerates which are at least 53 nm tall are present
\autocite{Murugathas2020}. It is unclear why the extent of vertical
aggregation differs between this work and that of Murugathas \emph{et
al.}, but may be linked to the difference in morphology between the
networks used. One possibility is that nanodiscs will preferentially
attach to metallic carbon nanotubes, but prefer to attach to each other
instead of semiconducting nanotubes. A semiconducting tubes in a highly
bundled network may block proteins from accessing metallic tubes in the
same bundle, leading to a greater degree of self-attachment.

\caption{\label{fig-PBASE-GFP-ORs}The fluorescence images on the left
side \(-\) (a), (c) and (e) \(-\) show unencapsulated carbon nanotube
network channels from a device incubated in GFP-OR nanodiscs. The
rectangular dark regions to the left and right of each image are the
gold electrodes. The fluorescence images on the right \(-\) (b), (d) and

and GFP-OR nanodisc incubation. Images (a) and (c) are both of the same

channel on the second, but (c) and (d) were taken using a greater
magnification. The insets in (c)-(f) compare the central channel region
of (c)-(f) more directly. All images were taken with the same microscope
settings (GFP filter and 10 s exposure time), taken in quick succession,
directly after functionalisation in a dark room.}

\end{figure}

Fluorescence microscopy was also used to confirm the presence of
GFP-tagged odorant receptors on the carbon nanotube network. A device
was functionalised using nanodiscs with odorant receptors attached to
\emph{Aequorea Victoria} green fluorescent protein (GFP) using the
process described at the beginning of this section. When these nanodiscs
were used, the functionalisation was performed in darkness, with the
odorant receptor nanodisc vial transported under an opaque cover to
protect it from light (batch number ND-GFP-OR43b-0002, prepared 12
months earlier). After functionalisation, devices were briefly rinsed
with DI water and nitrogen dried to remove dried-down salt residue left
by the \(1 \times\) PBS. A control device was also prepared without the
use of PBASE, skipping steps 3 and 4 in the functionalisation process.
Fluorescence images of the GFP-OR functionalised and control devices are
shown in Figure~\ref{fig-PBASE-GFP-ORs}. Note that fluorescence
microscope images were taken immediately after functionalisation;
devices were transported to the fluorescence microscope room in a
foil-wrapped container, and the fluorescence microscope room was kept
dark while images were taken.

The silicon dioxide regions in each image appear bright under the GFP
filter, indicating attachment between the GFP-OR nanodiscs and the
silicon dioxide substrate has occurred. As this device has been
annealed, UV exposed and developed before functionalisation, the
likelihood this unwanted attachment is to residual photoresist is
reduced significantly (see \textbf{?@sec-photoresist-contamination}).
The SiO\(_2\) substrate also appears brighter in the images on the right
of Figure~\ref{fig-PBASE-GFP-ORs}, which are of the device initially
exposed to PBASE. The discussion in \textbf{?@sec-pyrene-interactions}
indicates that the pyrene moiety of PBASE interacts with the silicon
dioxide substrate. Assuming no significant variation in the fluorescence
of GFP between nanodisc vials, the PBASE coating appears have led to
more nanodiscs attaching to the silicon dioxide, giving rise to the
brighter fluorescence of the silicon dioxide seen for the
PBASE-incubated device on the right of Figure~\ref{fig-PBASE-GFP-ORs}.

A comparison of fluorescence in the channel region between images on the
left of Figure~\ref{fig-PBASE-GFP-ORs} (GFP-OR nanodiscs) and the images
on the right (GFP-OR nanodiscs and PBASE) is given by the inset in
Figure~\ref{fig-PBASE-GFP-ORs} (c)-(f). The inset demonstrates that the
channels not incubated in PBASE are significantly less bright than those
that had been incubated with PBASE. It appears that the presence of
GFP-OR nanodiscs in \(1 \times\) PBS is limited on these channels.
However, when the carbon nanotubes are modified with PBASE, the GFP-OR
nanodiscs are able to attach to the channel, and so the channel shows up
brightly under the fluorescence microscope GFP filter. Importantly,
since the GFP is attached to odorant receptors rather than the nanodiscs
themselves, there must be odorant receptors present on the channel after
functionalisation; attachment to the channel is not limited to empty
nanodiscs. This trend was consistent across all conducting channels on
each of the two devices. As far as I know, this is the first time
fluorescence has been used to investigate the attachment of odorant
receptor nanodiscs to a carbon nanotube network.

The procedure used for biosensor detection of ethyl hexanoate in liquid
was the same as the procedure outlined in \textbf{?@sec-dummy-sensing},
except 0.5\% v/v DMSO was present in the buffer solution (to improve
ethyl hexanoate solubility) and dilutions of ethyl hexanoate in the same
0.5\% v/v DMSO \(1 \times\) PBS buffer solution were added during the
sensing series. Dilutions of 1 fM, 1 pM, 1 nM and 1 µM ethyl hexanoate
in 0.5\% v/v DMSO \(1 \times\) PBS were prepared before device
characterisation according to Table~\ref{tbl-dilution-preparation},
using pre-prepared concentrations of 200 fM, 200 pM, 200 nM and 200 µM
ethyl hexanoate in DMSO. The ethyl hexanoate in DMSO dilutions were
prepared beforehand as a 1:10 dilution series in DMSO using 200 mM stock
solution, where dilutions ranged from 20 mM to 200 fM. Sampling
measurements were taken using the B1500A semiconductor device analyser,
with the transfer measurement in Figure~\ref{fig-OR22a-TX-comparison}
(b) taken directly before sensing. The full control series plus sensing
sequence is shown in Figure~\ref{fig-EtHex-aqueous-sensing}. Gate
current remained negligible across the entire sensing procedure.

\caption{\label{fig-OR22a-control-series}The control series for the
OR22a-functionalised device is shown in (a), alongside an extrapolated
linear fit to the control series from 1200 s onwards. The control series
with the linear approximation subtracted fitted to an exponential curve
is shown in (b).}

\end{figure}

The control series for the sensing series is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-OR22a-control-series} (a). No clear stepwise response is
seen to buffer additions or subtractions. The functionalised device
shows similar baseline drift behaviour to that of a pristine device,
with a period of short-term decay quickly yielding to a more long-lived
decay behaviour. A linear fit \(I = c_1t + c_2\) to the region
\(1200-1800\) s had a gradient of \(c_1 = -1.76\pm0.02\) pA/s. This
gradient is smaller than the range of values found for the linear fit
approximating the longer-term drift of a pristine device
(\textbf{?@sec-baseline-drift}), but of the same order of magnitude. The
linear fit was then subtracted from the control series and an
exponential fit \(I = I_0\exp(-t/\tau)\) was performed on the remaining
dataset, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig-OR22a-control-series} (b). A value
of \(590 \pm 3\) s was found for the exponential time constant, similar
to those found for the channels of the pristine device. This confirms
that the 1800 s control series is sufficient to avoid the presence of
short-term decay during sensing.

It appears that the exponential fit overestimates current measurements
between 1100 s and 1500 s and underestimates measurements between 1500 s
and 1800 s. This deviation from the fit may result from the linear
approximation used to represent long-term baseline drift being weaker
for this channel than for those discussed previously in
\textbf{?@sec-dummy-sensing} and \textbf{?@sec-pristine-EtHex}. This
could result from the exponential terms for long-term baseline drift
having relatively short time constants, so \(t\ll\tau_i\) no longer
holds and higher order terms in the linear approximation are no longer
negligible. This observation may indicate a relationship exists between
device functionalisation and the long-lived device decay behaviour.
However, it may simply result from the natural variation between
randomly-deposited device channels. Further work may be required to
confirm the existence of such a relationship, though this work is
outside the scope of this thesis.

Figure~\ref{fig-OR22a-sensing-series} shows the cleaned and filtered
ethyl hexanoate sensing data from the OR22a-functionalised device from
1800 s onwards. The concentration of each 20 µL addition is indicated
above the corresponding addition time. The actual concentration in the
liquid-gate well is determined by both the concentration of analyte
being added and the volume of 1XPBS 0.5\% v/v DMSO already present. The
concentration of ethyl hexanoate in the well after each addition is
shown in Table~\ref{tbl-concentrations}. With each addition of ethyl
hexanoate, a subsequent rapid drop in source-drain current across the
channel was observed. This current decrease appears irreversible, as the
current stabilises after each addition at a lower current level than
prior to the addition. The relationship between ethyl hexanoate
concentration in the sensing well and the first four signal responses of
the OR22a-functionalised device are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-EtHex-responses}. Both mammalian and insect odorant
receptors show a logarthmic electrical response to low concentrations of
target analyte, which saturates for higher concentrations of analyte
\autocite{Persaud1982,Khadka2019,Murugathas2020,Cheema2021}. This trend
has been observed for OR22a responses to both methyl hexanoate and ethyl
hexanoate on different sensing platforms, where saturation occurs at
high picomolar concentrations. As in previous works, responses were
observed without requiring the presence of an ORCO coreceptor
\autocite{Murugathas2019b,Murugathas2020,Khadka2019,Cheema2021}.

\caption{\label{fig-EtHex-responses}Device response against the ethyl
hexanoate (EtHex) concentration present in the device liquid-gate
corresponding to the first four 20 µL analyte additions.}

\end{figure}

However, the final addition resulted in an unexpectedly large response
of \(\sim\) 45\% which dramatically deviates from this well-established
trend. This large response occurs when the concentration of ethyl
hexanoate in the well is roughly doubled from \(\sim\) 100 nM to
\(\sim\) 200 nM. The size of this response well exceeds any error due to
insufficient mixing in the PDMS, which is usually on the scale of
\(\sim\) 1\% (\textbf{?@sec-salt-conc-series}). The analsyis in the
subsequent section (Section~\ref{sec-variability}) demonstrates that
this response cannot be explained as the carbon nanotubes (or nanodiscs)
responding to a relatively large concentration of ethyl hexanoate
directly. No significant changes in gate current occur during the
sensing series (Figure~\ref{fig-EtHex-aqueous-sensing}), so the response
cannot be explained as being due to changes in the gate capacitance due
to leakage current. The responses of OR22a to target analyte at well
concentrations above 1 nM has not previously been investigated for
field-effect transistor sensors
\autocite{Murugathas2019b,Murugathas2020}. More research may be required
to understand device behaviour at analyte concentrations well above the
apparent saturation regime at high picomolar concentrations.

\subsection{Variability in Biosensor
Behaviour}\label{sec-variability-biosensor}}

Despite the successful detection of ethyl hexanoate by an OR22a
nanodisc-functionalised biosensor in
Section~\ref{sec-aqueous-sensing-EtHex}, it was found that this
behaviour was not readily reproducible. The results from the previous
section were not repeated when using the same procedure for fabrication
of devices alongside an identical functionalisation process with the
same batch of OR22a nanodiscs (ND-OR22a-SB018). The ethyl hexanoate
sensing sequence from six functionalised device channels is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-OR22a-variability}. Figure~\ref{fig-OR22a-variability}
(a) has been left unfiltered to illustrate the variation in behaviour
between channels, while Figure~\ref{fig-OR22a-variability} (b) has been
prepared in the same manner as Figure~\ref{fig-OR22a-sensing-series}
(a). The current response to each analyte addition is similar to that
seen after the initial addition without ethyl hexanoate present. The
largest contributing factor to current change appears to be drift.
Unlike the clear decreases in current subsequent to ethyl hexanoate
additions seen in Figure~\ref{fig-OR22a-sensing-series} (a), no
decreases are seen in Figure~\ref{fig-OR22a-variability} (b) to any
ethyl hexanoate solution addition.

Liquid-gated electrical characteristics were taken of each sensing
channel from this device before and after functionalisation with OR22a
nanodiscs, in the same manner as
Section~\ref{sec-aqueous-sensing-EtHex}. These characteristics are shown
in Figure~\ref{fig-OR22a-variability-TX}. The average threshold shift
was \(-0.06\pm0.02\), the same as that of a device functionalised with
PBASE in methanol without subsequent functionalisation with OR22a
nanodiscs. To test whether protein was present on the channel, an atomic
force microscope image was taken of channel 6, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-OR22a-variability-AFM}. The same image analysis as in
Section~\ref{sec-aqueous-sensing-EtHex} was performed, with the
substrate mask shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-OR22a-variability-AFM-comparison} (a) giving an average
substrate height of \(3.8\pm0.4\). A binary representation of the image
with a 12.5 nm threshold, 8.7 nm above the average substrate height, is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig-OR22a-variability-AFM-comparison} (b). As with
the functionalised device in Figure~\ref{fig-crosssection} (b),
Figure~\ref{fig-OR22a-variability-AFM-comparison} (b) shows clustering
of features, many of which are larger than 50 nm across. It seems,
therefore, that nanodisc aggregates up to 27.5 nm high are present on
channel 6, despite the lack of a significant threshold shift as a result
of functionalisation.

Both OR nanodisc and empty nanodisc attachment via PBASE have been shown
to cause significant gating of the network
(Section~\ref{sec-aqueous-sensing-EtHex}). Therefore, it might be
reasoned that the lack of a gating effect, but with nanodiscs present,
results from a direct attachment mechanism circumventing the PBASE
linker. The amine group on proteins can be attached directly onto carbon
nanotubes by adsorption, although this attachment is relatively weak
\autocite{Bradley2004}. Figure~\ref{fig-OR22a-noPBASE-AFM} shows an AFM
image of a carbon nanotube network film after submersion in a 10 µL/mL
OR22a nanodisc in PBS solution for 1 hour (batch NDOR22a-0016-1),
without prior exposure to PBASE in methanol.
Figure~\ref{fig-OR22a-noPBASE-AFM-comparison} shows the substrate mask
in (a) and a binary representation of this AFM with nanodisc aggregates
clearly visible in (b). In
Figure~\ref{fig-OR22a-variability-TX-comparison} (a), the negative
threshold shift of a channel modified in this way was -0.27 V, similar
in size to the shift due to functionalisation seen for the working
biosensor.

The attachment of nanodiscs in \(1 \times\) PBS may seem surprising,
given that the fluorescence microscopy work in
Section~\ref{sec-working-PBASE-functionalisation} indicates no GFP-OR
present after functionalisation without PBASE. However, this device
channel did not work as a sensor when tested with ethyl hexanoate.
Figure~\ref{fig-OR22a-variability-TX-comparison} (b) shows a small,
positive current response to additions of ethyl hexanoate diluted in 1\%
v/v DMSO \(1 \times\) PBS, which may result from the weakly attached
OR22a nanodiscs being mechanically removed by the pressure of each
addition on the device channels.

An explanation is required for the seemingly contradictory situation
where nanodiscs can be present on a device channel without significant
gating effects. The most straightforward explanation is that no reliable
correlation exist between the two phenomena. Given the consistent
threshold shift results for various linker functionalisations seen in
\textbf{?@sec-noncovalent-functionalisation}, this scenario implies a
significant variation in protein structure and charge behaviour within a
single nanodisc batch, which seems unlikely. Another possibility is that
some type of surface coating is causing nanodiscs to not attach to
either PBASE or the carbon nanotubes. This surface coating might be
attractive, attaching to both nanodiscs and carbon nanotubes, but
forming a barrier layer between the two. Alternatively, this coating
might be repulsive, causing nanodiscs to attach weakly to the substrate
around the carbon nanotubes. Variations in the degree to which a network
is coated may then explain why the same functionalisation method might
work for one device but not another. The following section investigates
ways of eliminating possible sources of surface coating for more
reliable functionalisation results.

\hypertarget{sec-contamination}{%
\subsection{Potential Sources of Variability}\label{sec-contamination}}

Throughout the course of this thesis, multiple potential candidates for
the unwanted surface coating discussed in the previous section have been
identified. These include the surfactant used in carbon nanotube
deposition (\textbf{?@sec-pristine-morphology},
\textbf{?@sec-pristine-electrical-characterisation}), the solvent used
in functionalisation (\textbf{?@sec-PBASE-electrical-characterisation}),
residual photoresist (\textbf{?@sec-photoresist-contamination}), and the
hydrophobic layer which naturally forms on graphene and carbon nanotubes
in air (\textbf{?@sec-hydrophobicity}). Another possibility is that
PBASE itself is acting as a surface coating, which could result from
multilayer coverage restricting access by the odorant receptors to
directly attached PBASE (\textbf{?@sec-PBASE-attachment}).
Alternatively, PBASE may have hydrolysed into PBA prior to attachment,
forming an inert surface layer upon \(\pi\)-stacking around the carbon
nanotubes. However, no threshold shift directly attributable to PBA
attachment should occur (\textbf{?@sec-PBA-characterisation}), and this
is not what was observed when characterising the non-working device in
Section~\ref{sec-variability-biosensor}. To understand which of these
candidates is responsible for the significant variability in biosensor
functionality, the sensing procedure was performed with slight
variations on the biosensor fabrication and functionalisation
procedures. In each test, an individual element of one of these
procedures was altered to prevent the introduction of a specific surface
coating. The biosensor was then characterised and tested to see if it
would respond to its target odorant.

\caption{\label{fig-DMSO-concentration}Response to changing the
concentration of DMSO in the PDMS well of a OR22a-functionalised sensor.
Source-drain current was set at \(V_{ds}\) = 100 mV while gate current
was set at \(V_g\) = 0 V. The well originally contained 100 µL of 1\%
v/v DMSO 1X PBS. 20 µL additions of DMSO in PBS were made at 3300 s and
3600 s.}

\end{figure}

Before testing to see if a surface coating was responsible for the lack
of response seen to ethyl hexanoate by the device in
Section~\ref{sec-variability-biosensor}, it was important to investigate
the possibility the signals seen in
Section~\ref{sec-EtHex-aqueous-sensing} were false positives. The highly
sensitive device channel could credibly respond to three different rapid
environmental changes occurring with each addition: the mechanical
action of the addition, a difference between the 0.5\% v/v DMSO in
\(1 \times\) PBS containing the analyte and the 0.5\% v/v DMSO in
\(1 \times\) PBS already in the well, or a direct response to analyte.
It is important to eliminate the first two possibilities to be certain
that the device is responding to analyte. The control series as it
stands demonstrates responses cannot be explained by mechanical action.
All analyte solutions are prepared simultaneously using the same
\(1 \times\) PBS, taking care to avoid cross-contamination, so responses
are unlikely to result from a difference between the \(1 \times\) PBS in
the analyte solution and the \(1 \times\) PBS in the well. It then must
be verified whether a functionalised device channel will respond to a
change in DMSO concentration, which is the result of the DMSO
concentration in an analyte addition being different to the
concentration in the PDMS well.

Figure~\ref{fig-DMSO-concentration} shows that a increase in DMSO
concentration in the well from 1\% v/v to 2.5\% v/v leads to a steep
drop in current of 0.5\% \(-\) 1.5\% across two OR22a-functionalised
device channels. The gate current remained negligible across this time
period (\textless0.1\% of average drain current).

\end{figure}

Though the current changes in Figure~\ref{fig-DMSO-concentration} share
similarities with other observed responses to analyte, they are
significantly smaller than the \textgreater2\% changes seen in
Section~\ref{sec-EtHex-aqueous-sensing}. Furthermore, precise
measurement of DMSO in analyte preparations means that a change in
proportion of DMSO in the well of this scale is unlikely. It therefore
seems improbable that a change in DMSO concentration is the primary
cause of these responses. However, the author recommends a slight
modification to the control series for a more robust experimental
baseline. For a device with 100 µL 0.5\% v/v DMSO \(1 \times\) PBS in
the well after the first buffer addition at 100 s, a subsequent 20 µL
addition of 1\% v/v DMSO \(1 \times\) PBS at 200 s and 20 µL addition of
0\% v/v DMSO \(1 \times\) PBS addition at 300 s can be used to check for
spurious responses due to changing DMSO concentration, while ensuring
the DMSO concentration in the well is 0.5\% v/v after the control
series.

Two different approaches were trialled to eliminate possible surfactant
contamination, both of which drew heavily on previous methods used for
iOR biosensor fabrication \autocite{Murugathas2019b,Murugathas2020}.
Solvent-deposited carbon nanotube network and graphene devices were
fabricated as described in \textbf{?@sec-qw-processing}. The same
functionalisation process for each device was used as described in
Section~\ref{sec-working-PBASE-functionalisation} with OR22a nanodiscs.

The normalised sensing behaviour for the solvent-deposited carbon
nanotube device is shown in Figure~\ref{fig-solvent-deposited-sensing}.
The device shows a small current increase on four channels with the 10
fM ethyl hexanoate addition, and a small decrease on five channels with
the 100 fM EtHex addition. No current change exceeded 2\%, and as shown
in Figure~\ref{fig-solvent-deposited-sensing} (b), the current changes
appear negligible on the scale of the changes seen in
Section~\ref{sec-EtHex-aqueous-sensing}. The average threshold shift
from functionalisation was \(-0.02\pm0.01\) V, which indicates
attachment of PBASE but not nanodiscs. As the device was made using the
pre-2023 encapsulation mask, an AFM was taken of a separate film
modified in the same manner, shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-solvent-deposited-AFM-comparison} (a). The average
substrate height was \(11.3\pm0.9\) nm. A binary representation of the
image taken at the minimum height no spindle-like bundles were visible,
46.1 nm, is shown in Figure~\ref{fig-solvent-deposited-AFM-comparison}
(b). Attached nanodisc aggregations are clearly visible, and appear
closer in nature to those observed for an OR35a-functionalised film
\autocite{Murugathas2020} than previously seen in this work.
Figure~\ref{fig-solvent-deposited-AFM-comparison} (c) and (d) show that
over a larger scale these aggregations can be at least 330 nm tall,
forming large clusters which may indicate mutual interaction during
deposition.

previously are shown in Figure~\ref{fig-graphene-sensing-TX} (a),
showing an order of magnitude decrease in on-current and a negatively
shifted Dirac point with functionalisation, as seen previously for
working OR22a nanodisc GFET biosensors \autocite{Murugathas2020}.
Figure~\ref{fig-graphene-sensing-TX} (b) shows when the process is
repeated on another device without initial exposure to PBASE and
methanol, a larger negative shift in the Dirac point is observed. It
appears the initial functionalisation with PBASE and methanol decreases
the charge transferred to the graphene when the nanodiscs are
introduced; the difference between these two surface modifications is
analogous to that seen for the carbon nanotube devices in
Section~\ref{sec-variability-biosensor}. A pristine graphene surface and
a OR22a-functionalised graphene surface are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-graphene-AFM-comparison} (a) and (b) respectively.
Graphene folds of up to 7.3 nm in height are visible on the right hand
side of Figure~\ref{fig-graphene-AFM-comparison} (a). When
functionalised with OR22a nanodiscs, the surface is densely coated with
nanodisc aggregates up to \(\sim\) 250 nm across and \(\sim\) 30 nm
tall. These nanodiscs are a similar height and size to those observed by
Murugathas \emph{et al.} \autocite{Murugathas2020}.

Both the transfer characteristics and atomic force microscope image
indicates widespread attachment of nanodiscs. However, the normalised
current data from a OR22a nanodisc graphene field-effect transistor in
Figure~\ref{fig-graphene-sensing} shows current changes of \textless1\%
in response to ethyl hexanoate additions. This contrasts with the OR22a
nanodisc-functionalised graphene device behaviour observed by Murugathas
\emph{et al.}, where target analyte additions with concentration above
10 fM consistently caused current changes of above 2\%
\autocite{Murugathas2020}. Again, there appears to be an unresolved
functionalisation issue that is not clearly captured either by the
atomic force microscope images or the transfer characteristics before
and after functionalisation of the graphene devices.

It appears that avoiding the use of surfactant on the transducer element
is not sufficient to ensure consistent iOR biosensor functionalisation;
it therefore seems likely that a surfactant coating is not the primary
reason for the observed variability in device operation. Furthermore,
the confounding factor appears to persist across multiple transducer
morphologies which show significant variations in both their active
surface area and electrical properties.

Next, an investigation was made into whether the type of solvent used in
functionalisation was responsible for the variability observed in device
behaviour. A solvent commonly used in the literature for
functionalisation with PBASE is dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), as discussed
in \textbf{?@sec-PBASE-attachment}. A surfactant-deposited device was
functionalised with OR22a nanodiscs in the same manner as described in
Section~\ref{sec-working-PBASE-functionalisation}, except DMSO was used
instead of methanol when preparing the PBASE solution. The sensing
dataset from the four device channels of a suitable current level are
displayed in Figure~\ref{fig-DMSO-sensing} (a), where methyl hexanoate
(MeHex) was used as the target compound. No channel shows a negative
current response to MeHex. Current changes after each addition are
consistently below 1\% on all channels, and therefore appear negligible
on the scale used in Figure~\ref{fig-DMSO-sensing} (b).

is also shown.}

\end{figure}

An atomic force microscope images of a film modified using DMSO in PBASE
with OR22a nanodiscs is shown in Figure~\ref{fig-DMSO-AFM-comparison}
(a), along with a mask in green indicating an average substrate height
of \(3.6\pm0.6\). The binary representation in
Figure~\ref{fig-DMSO-AFM-comparison} (b) shows long, rounded features
sit directly above the above the CNT threshold height of 12.3 nm. By
extending the threshold height range to \(12.3-18.9\) nm, it becomes
apparent that these features are not simply large carbon nanotube
bundles, but instead appear to be densely packed collections of nanodisc
aggregates following the length of various carbon nanotube bundles. The
distribution of nanodiscs along the nanotubes gives them a string of
pearls or \emph{Hormosira}-like appearance
\autocite{NewZealandPlantConservationNetwork}. Some features are too
tall for the ``pearls'' on the ``string'' to be individually
distinguished in Figure~\ref{fig-DMSO-AFM-comparison} (c), but
Figure~\ref{fig-DMSO-AFM-comparison} (d) shows every rounded ``pearl''
along every ``string'' can be distinguished from one another at a taller
threshold. These images strongly suggest nanodisc aggregates are present
on the network, but does not necessarily indicate a direct connection
between nanodiscs and the network.

The transfer characteristics of the four sensing channels are displayed
in Figure~\ref{fig-DMSO-TX}. An average threshold shift of
\(-0.22\pm0.03\) V is seen across these channels, significantly
exceeding the expected threshold shifts of \(-0.06\pm0.01\) for exposure
to PBASE in DMSO and \(-0.15\pm0.01\) for exposure to DMSO without
PBASE. This functionalisation threshold shift is similar to that of the
device which responded to target analyte in
Section~\ref{sec-EtHex-aqueous-sensing}, -0.20 V. The shift is also
similar to that seen for the device functionalised directly with OR22a
nanodiscs without PBASE, -0.27 V. It therefore seems that the nanodiscs
are directly attached to the carbon nanotube network, yet they do not
respond to the target analyte. It seems likely that the negative gating
is a result of nanodisc attachment to the network, either with or
without PBASE as a linker; meanwhile, there is limited or no attachment
between the network and the odorant receptors themselves. This lack of
connection to the odorant receptors appears to be a second factor at
play in the variability seen in biosensor behaviour.

As discussed in \textbf{?@sec-PBASE-purity}, DMSO is a highly
hygroscopic solvent. If a non-negligible amount of water is present in
the DMSO during functionalisation, the PBASE is being exposed to water
for more than an hour before introducing OR nanodiscs. Over this time
period, the PBASE may be able to undergo ester hydrolysis
\autocite{Hermanson2013-3}. To eliminate the possibility that hydrolysis
has prevented the attachment of odorant receptors to PBASE on the
network, an alternative method using 1-pyrenebutyric acid (PBA) in DMSO
was also trialled. This method was similar to those seen in
\textbf{?@sec-PBA}. PBA is first attached to the carbon nanotube
network, then, once the bulk of the DMSO has been rinsed off the device
surface, converted to PBASE using carbodiimide (EDC) and succinimide
(NHS) reagents. The PBASE is then available to attach to the OR22a
nanodiscs as usual. The functionalisation process with PBA was therefore
the same as in Section~\ref{sec-working-PBASE-functionalisation}, with
the following steps replacing steps \(3-4\):

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A solution of 5 mM PBA (Setareh Biotech) in DMSO was prepared by fully
  dissolving 7 mg PBASE in 5 mL DMSO by vortex mixing at 1000 rpm.
\item
  The device was left submerged in the 5 mM PBASE in DMSO solution for 1
  hour in a parafilm-sealed container.
\item
  A solution of 20 mM EDC and 40 mM NHS in \(1 \times\) PBS was prepared
  by dissolving 31 mg EDC and 46 mg NHS in 10 mL \(1 \times\) PBS.
\end{itemize}

Note: EDC was thawed under vacuum for 15 minutes in dark conditions
before opening.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The device was rinsed with DMSO for 15 s and \(1 \times\) PBS for 15
  s, then placed into the EDC/NHS solution for 30 minutes.
\item
  The device was then rinsed with \(1 \times\) PBS for 15s before OR22a
  nanodisc functionalisation.
\end{itemize}

These steps were designed to be broadly similar to those seen in
\textbf{?@sec-PBA}, with an molar excess of NHS relative to EDC to
ensure full conversion of the \emph{O}-acylisourea intermediate into
PBASE. Normalised, filtered sensing series from two multiplexed channels
of the functionalised device are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-EDCNHS-sensing}. Again, any current response subsequent
to additions is positive and \textless1\%. An atomic force microscope
image of a film modified in the same manner as the sensing device is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig-EDCNHS-AFM-comparison} (a), with substrate
height \(3.9\pm1.5\) nm. When a suitable height range above the
threshold height 12.6 nm is selected, as in
Figure~\ref{fig-EDCNHS-AFM-comparison} (b), highly clustered nanodisc
features with the appearance of pearls on a string are again visible.
The transfer characteristics of each channel before and after
functionalisation are shown in Figure~\ref{fig-EDCNHS-TX}, where an
average threshold shift of \(-0.12\pm0.01\) V is observed. In
\textbf{?@sec-PBA-characterisation}, the threshold shift for PBA
attachment in DMSO was -0.15 V. The difference between these two values
is not large enough to convincingly conclude whether nanodiscs have
attached via PBASE or not. It therefore appears that the problem
identified with variability in device behaviour in
Section~\ref{sec-variability-biosensor} is not resolved by the use of a
different solvent or steps to prevent PBASE hydrolysis.

From this elimination process, three possible sources of variability in
device performance due to nanoscale surface contamination remain. The
first is the hydrocarbonaceous layer that forms due to device exposure
to air, which causes channel hydrophobicity. The second is multilayer
adhesion of PBASE or PBA on the transducer surface. Finally, photoresist
may remain on the device channels, even despite the use of a new method
which eliminates photoresist to levels invisible under a fluorescence
microscope (\textbf{?@sec-photoresist-contamination}). A further
possible source of variability was also identified from the PBASE in
DMSO functionalisation, where transfer measurements and AFM imaging both
strongly suggested direct attachment of nanodiscs despite the device not
functioning as a sensor: attachment of nanodiscs, but with minimal or no
attachment of the contained odorant receptors. An altered non-covalent
functionalisation method using pyrene-PEG-biotin was therefore developed
to eliminate all of the above factors at once and investigate the
resulting sensor behaviour. This novel method is trialled in the
following section.

A carbon nanotube network field-effect transistor device, fabricated

was functionalised with a novel method using OR10a solubilised in
surfactant. The odorant receptors were not expressed in a nanodisc
format, and were avidin-tagged or ``avi-tagged''. This eliminates the
possibility of nanodiscs interfering with odorant receptor attachment,
though does leave them vunerable to harsh environmental conditions
\autocite{Nath2007,Bayburt2010}. Upon preparation, the odorant receptors
were modified with pyrene-PEG-biotin. The pyrene-PEG-biotin linker
attached to the avi-tags on the odorant receptors, as described in
\textbf{?@sec-NTA-biotin-PEG}, allowing them to attach directly from
solution to the carbon nanotubes via the attached pyrene linker. This
approach meant that no PBASE, PBA or organic solvent was needed in the
functionalisation process. To eliminate the remaining possible sources
of surface contamination, such as the hydrocarbonaceous coating of
nanotubes and residual photoresist, a short oxgyen plasma cleaning step
was used.

\end{enumerate}

Figure~\ref{fig-OR10a-TX-comparison} (a) shows the liquid-gated
characteristics of a device channel (channel 2) before and after the
functionalisation process with OR10a. The change of characteristics
observed can be compared with the change of characteristics seen for a
plasma clean only, seen in Figure~\ref{fig-OR10a-TX-comparison} (b). A
significant drop in channel occurs as a result of the plasma cleaning
process. This large change in mobility makes it difficult to clearly
identify changes in gating specifically due to the presence of the
OR10a. The OR10a is not held within a nanodisc format, so the morphology
of the functionalised network cannot be compared directly using previous
atomic force microscope images. A solvent-deposited carbon nanotube film
was prepared separately using OR nanodiscs, where the ORs were attached
via their amine group using pyrene-PEG-NHS ester. Pyrene-PEG-NHS ester
is very similar to PBASE but contains a PEG chain.
Figure~\ref{fig-PPN-linker} shows an atomic force microscope image of
the modified film. OR nanodisc aggregates very clearly follow the carbon
nanotubes, indicating specific attachment between nanodiscs and carbon
nanotubes can be acheived using linker containing pyrene-PEG. The
presence of PEG chains may help prevent direct adsorption of proteins
onto the carbon nanotubes, improving device quality and therefore
sensing behaviour \autocite{Star2003a,Chen2004}.

\subsection{Aqueous Sensing of Methyl
Salicylate}\label{sec-MeSal-aqueous-sensing}}

The procedure used for sensing methyl salicylate (MeSal) was identical
to that used in Section~\ref{sec-EtHex-aqueous-sensing}, except using
MeSal instead of EtHex. Analyte solutions in 0.5\% DMSO/\(1 \times\) PBS
solution containing methyl salicylate concentrations at 1 fM, 1 pM, 1 nM
and 1 µM were prepared beforehand, The same buffer was used for each
dilution, as well as for the well, which contained 80 µL 0.5\%
DMSO/\(1 \times\) PBS prior to sensing. Sensing measurements were taken
using the NI-PXIe system. The full control series plus sensing sequence
is shown in Figure~\ref{fig-MeSal-sensing}. Gate current remained
negligible across the full sensing procedure, and no responses were seen
to buffer additions or subtractions. A linear fit to the baseline drift
in the region \(1200-1800\) s, shown in Figure~\ref{fig-OR10a-drift}
(a), had a gradient of \(c_1 = -0.38\pm0.01\) pA/s, while an exponential
fit to the drift minus the linear fit, shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-OR10a-drift} (b), had a time constant of \(506 \pm 12\)
s. A deviation from the exponential fit similar to that seen for the
control series in Section~\ref{sec-EtHex-aqueous-sensing} is observed,
indicating that \(t\ll\tau_i\) does not hold for the drift behaviour and
further lending support to the possibility that functionalised devices
exhibit characteristic long-term decay behaviour.

Cleaned and filtered methyl salicylate sensing data with linear baseline
drift removed is shown in Figure~\ref{fig-OR10a-responses} (a). The
concentration of each 20 µL methyl salicylate addition is shown above
each corresponding addition time. Significant and irreversible current
decreases occurred directly after the 1 fM and 1 nM MeSal additions.
Figure~\ref{fig-OR10a-responses} (b) shows that a \(\sim\) 3\% current
drop occurred subsequent to the 1 fM addition and a \(\sim\) 23\%
current drop occurred subsequent to the 1 nM MeSal addition. No negative
change in current occurred after the buffer addition, or any of the
other three analyte additions. Murugathas \emph{et al.} also observed a
similar drop-off in response with increased analyte concentration when
sensing with OR10a \autocite{Murugathas2019b}. It appears that the OR10a
odorant receptors saturate at a low concentration relative to the OR22a
odorant receptors tested earlier. Transfer characteristics of the device
before and after sensing are shown in Figure~\ref{fig-OR10a-TX-1} (a),
showing a threshold shift of -0.07 V.

The device was then rinsed for 15 s in \(1 \times\) PBS after the
initial sensing series. The effect of the rinse on the transfer
characteristics of the device is illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig-OR10a-TX-1} (b). The rinsing step appears to have
largely restored the electrical characteristics of device to their state
prior to sensing. It appears the gating effect due to the presence of
analyte has been reversed. Assuming that this effect results from
structural changes in the odorant receptors, the reversal of threshold
shift upon rinsing indicates that without analyte present, the proteins
return to their original structure. This implies that the device can be
reused as a sensor. Furthermore, as adsorption of solvent leads to
gating which is not reversible through rinsing
(\textbf{?@sec-PBASE-electrical-characterisation}), this is also an
indication that the responses are not simply due to adsorption of the
DMSO present.

\caption{\label{fig-OR10a-responses-2}A second methyl salicylate sensing
series was performed with the OR10a-functionalised device channel
subsequent to rinsing, shown in Figure~\ref{fig-OR10a-responses-2} (a).
Source-drain current was set at \(V_{ds}\) = 100 mV while gate current
was set at \(V_g\) = 0 V. No responses to 0.5\% v/v DMSO \(1 \times\)
PBS additions or significant gate current leakage were observed in (a).
A clear response is observed after each nanomolar addition of methyl
salicylate in (b). The current data in (b) has had a moving median
filter applied and linear baseline drift removed.}

\end{figure}

A second methyl salicylate sensing series was then performed with the
same device, shown in Figure~\ref{fig-OR10a-responses-2} (a). The linear
component of baseline drift from \(1200-1800\) s had a gradient of
\(c_1 = -0.31\pm0.01\) pA/s, similar that seen in the previous sensing
run. A current response was seen directly after all five analyte
additions, shown in Figure~\ref{fig-OR10a-responses-2} (b). Only
nanomolar additions of methyl salicylate were used to avoid saturating
the proteins and reducing the sensitivity of the sensor. Interestingly,
the initial 1 nM analyte addition was similar in size (24\%) to the
current change resulting from the 1 nM analyte addition in
Figure~\ref{fig-OR10a-responses} (23\%). This result indicates that the
size of responses may correspond to the well concentration in a
reproducible manner, where there is a specific change in well
concentration that gives the largest response. Five successive 20 µL 1
nM methyl salicylate additions to the 100 µL buffer in the well results
in a well concentration of 500 pM MeSal. Given the steady decrease in
analyte response size with successive additions in
Figure~\ref{fig-OR10a-responses-2}, it appears that the sensor saturates
at close to 500 pM, which may explain the lack of response to micromolar
additions in Figure~\ref{fig-OR10a-responses}.

\caption{\label{fig-OR10a-TX-2}Transfer characteristics of the device
directly before and after the 2nd sensing series, where \(V_{ds}\) = 100
mV.}

\end{figure}

It also appears that the second sensing series resulted in a similar
shift in transfer characteristics to that of the first series.
Figure~\ref{fig-OR10a-TX-2} shows a shift in threshold voltage of -0.08
V between the transfer characteristics directly before and directly
after the nanomolar sensing series. This is another indication that
nanomolar additions are enough to cause device saturation. The
similarity between Figure~\ref{fig-OR10a-TX-1} (a) and
Figure~\ref{fig-OR10a-TX-2} suggests a similar phenomenon has occurred
during both sensing series, indicating a odorant receptor-functionalised
device can be reused. This is surprising, given the odorant receptors
lack a protective membrane. This discussion indicates that the attached
odorant receptors can remain viable for at least several hours in room
temperature buffer solution, without the need for the nanodisc format.

This method has a number of advantages over the OR nanodisc
functionalisation method outlined earlier. The plasma cleaning step
eliminates uncertainty stemming from a variety of possible surface
coatings on the carbon nanotubes. Using detergent-solubilised odorant
receptors removes the possibility that the nanodiscs are impeding direct
attachment to odorant receptors in the functionalisation procedure.
However, it has its own drawbacks. Oxygen plasma cleaning, even at low
power, had a invasive effect on the carbon nanotube network. A large
drop in mobility resulted from plasma cleaning; for sparser carbon
nanotube morphologies, a sizable current drop could leave a device
unsuitable for sensing. Since the main advantage of non-covalent
functionalisation over covalent functionalisation is its minimal impact
on mobility (\textbf{?@sec-non-covalent-bonding}), this approach seems
self-contradictory. It appears a less invasive but solvent-free approach
should be identified for non-covalent functionalisation
\autocite{Ashraf2014}, or a well-established covalent approach should
instead be used for attaching odorant receptors
(\textbf{?@sec-sensor-types}).

\end{figure}

Despite the drawbacks outlined previously, the functionalisation method
in this section was also used to trial vapour phase sensing for the
odorant receptor devices. As the vapour pressure of methyl salicylate
was too low for reliable vapour system delivery, OR35a (batch number
AviHis-OR35a-001, prepared 12 months earlier) was used in the
functionalisation process instead of OR10a. OR35a responds to
\emph{trans}-2-hexen-1-al (E2Hex) \autocite{Murugathas2019b}, which is
suitable for use in the vapour delivery system. Back-gated transfer
characteristics of a OR35a-functionalised before and after
functionalisation are shown in Figure~\ref{fig-OR35a-TX-comparison} (a),
alongside characteristics from a device before and after plasma cleaning
at 5 W without subsequent functionalisation in
Figure~\ref{fig-OR35a-TX-comparison} (b). As expected, a significant
drop in mobility is seen as a result of the plasma cleaning step. Unlike
the functionalised device, the device plasma cleaned without
functionalisation turns off entirely at \(V_g \sim\) 3 V, with this
difference possibly due to variability in the results of plasma etching
for different carbon nanotube devices.

purged of vapour, the total dilution flow was set at 200 sccm (nominal)
and flow to the PID was set to 150 sccm on the flowmeter. In line with
the discussion in \textbf{?@sec-vapour-drift}, a 2500 s control series
was used. The baseline drift is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-OR35a-baseline-drift}, with a backgate of V\(_g\) = 0 V
and a source-drain voltage of V\(_{ds}\) = 100 mV across the channel
during each measurement. During this period, 200 sccm of nitrogen flow
was placed through the device chamber. A linear fit \(I = c_1t + c_2\)
was performed on the the measurements from each channel between
\(2150-3350\) s. For the pristine device, \(c_1 = -1.29\pm0.01\)
pAs\(^{-1}\), while for the OR35a-functionalised device,
\(c_1 = -0.55\pm0.01\) pAs\(^{-1}\).
Figure~\ref{fig-OR35a-baseline-drift} (b) shows the exponential fit
\(I = I_0\textrm{exp}(-t/\tau)\) to each dataset with linear drift
subtracted, where the time constant for the pristine device was
\(\tau = 963 \pm 25\) s and for the OR35a-functionalised device was
\(\tau = 704 \pm 4\) s.

\caption{\label{fig-E2Hex-sampling}Device channel responses to intervals
of flow from the carrier line into the vapour delivery system chamber,
showing responses by both the pristine and OR35a-functionalised devices.
Intervals begin at 3350 s, 4450 s and 5600 s. The length of each
interval is indicated above the corresponding normalised current
response to \emph{trans}-2-hexen-1-al (E2Hex) in (a). The dataset after
applying a moving median filter is shown in (b).}

\end{figure}

After the 2500 s control series, each device was exposed to three
intervals of \emph{trans}-2-hexen-1-al vapour flow from the carrier line
in the same manner. A total of 5 mL of the analyte of interest was
present in the analyte bottle before each sensing series. A total flow
of 200 sccm was kept through the chamber at all times. During each
interval, 150 sccm of this total flow passed through the carrier line.
Except during intervals, no flow was placed through the carrier line. A
1000 s recovery period was used between each interval. The temperature
was 20°C \(\pm\) 2°C during each series. These sensing series, which
have been normalised, despiked and corrected for drift, are shown
side-by-side in Figure~\ref{fig-E2Hex-sampling} (a), while
Figure~\ref{fig-E2Hex-sampling} (b) shows these series after a moving
median filter was applied. A larger current change is shown by the
functionalised device than the pristine device after each addition. The
PID indicated a similar concentration of E2Hex was present in the device
chamber with each addition, shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-E2Hex-additions-PID}. Note that measurements were taken
two days apart; the \$\sim\$50\% variation in chamber concentration
reached with each interval is largely due to PID span drift
(\textbf{?@sec-responses-to-vapour}).

\end{figure}

The current responses seen are not the sharp, clear responses to analyte
of the liquid-gated device seen in
Section~\ref{sec-MeSal-aqueous-sensing}. Instead, they seem more similar
to the responses by bare carbon nanotubes to vapour in
\textbf{?@sec-vapour-series}. There are also alternative explanations
for the current changes observed in Figure~\ref{fig-E2Hex-sampling}
which do not involve specific detection of analyte. The
functionalisation may have altered the drift behaviour so that the
linear approximation used here for removing baseline drift is no longer
useful. It may be useful for future works to incorporate computational
approaches to baseline drift compensation if the linear approximation
regularly breaks down for functionalised devices \autocite{Zhang2022}.
The breakdown in this approximation has then led to current increases
that do not directly correspond to analyte being added. The
functionalisation process may also have caused the device to become more
sensitive to changes in vapour concentration, increasing the
signal-to-noise ratio of the sensor. Regardless of their origin, the
current increases observed cannot fairly be described as clear or
convincing sensing responses. A working sensor should exhibit responses
more similar to those seen in Section~\ref{sec-MeSal-aqueous-sensing}.

the measurement, a PDMS well containing 50 µL 0.5\% v/v DMSO 1X PBS was

behaviour are indicated with red dotted lines.}

\end{figure}

It may be necessary to ensure the sensing environment is similar to that
used for aqueous sensing to achieve reliable sensing. A buffered
environment may help to stabilise the unprotected odorant receptors, and
so a PDMS well containing 50 µL 0.5\% v/v DMSO \(1 \times\) PBS was
attached to the device for vapour sensing. Despite the well being
upside-down in the vapour delivery system, the hydrophobicity of the
PDMS was sufficient to store the buffer securely. Current sampling over
a 1 hour period in this configuration, with 200 sccm constant flow
across the surface of the well, is presented in
Figure~\ref{fig-buffer-vapour}. If the well solution was leaking out of
the well, the conductive liquid could form a short between the channel
electrodes and backgate, prompting a large increase in gate current.
However, gate current remains stable across the entire measurement
period, indicating the well remains secure. Conversely, fluctuations in
drain current became apparent after \(\sim\) 800 s, and at \(\sim\) 2400
s, the direction of baseline drift was reversed entirely. These
undesirable changes appear to result from rapid evaporation of liquid in
the well; when the device chamber was opened, only \(\sim\) 10-20 µL of
buffer was present.

For readibly reproducible vapour sensing, therefore, one of two
approaches present themselves. The first approach is to identify a
covalent attachment mechanism that allows for specific attachment to
odorant receptors via a histidine or avidin tag. This approach allows
for a protective format like nanodiscs to be used in the sensing setup
while eliminating concerns around unwanted attachment of the protective
membrane protein. The weak nature of non-covalent binding lends itself
to variable functionalisation quality and poor reproducibility.
Non-covalent functionalisation may also be less suitable for use in
non-aqueous environments lacking buffer stabilisation \autocite{Li2023}.
Conversely, covalent functionalisation of mammalian-OR sensors has been
used before for successful vapour sensing of eugenol
\autocite{Goldsmith2011}. Alternatively, a similar process to the one
investigated here could be used. This non-covalent approach would
require the development of a highly reproducible cleaning process, able
to remove a variety of organic contaminants from the carbon nanotube
surface prior to functionalisation. Furthermore, a liquid capture layer
which is both biofriendly and has a low vapour pressure may need to be
identified and used. Ideally, this liquid would be miscible with a wide
range of substances, but repel PDMS. Further discussion of potential
capture layers can be found in \textbf{?@sec-future-work-vapour}.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

A carbon nanotube device was non-covalently functionalised using PBASE
in methanol with OR22a nanodiscs and operated as a biosensor in an
aqueous environment. Real-time decreases in current level across the
sensor channel by up to \(\sim\) 45\% were observed in response to
analyte additions. Short-term drift behaviour was found to be similar to
that of pristine devices, where the fast-decay exponential had a time
constant of \(590\pm3\) s, but it appears functionalisation may affect
long-term baseline drift. Quantitative changes resulting from sensor
functionalisation included a device threshold voltage shift of
\(-0.20\pm0.03\) V and a change in network height above the substrate by
up to \(\sim\) 5 nm, both resulting from the presence of nanodiscs on
the network. Additionally, to confirm the presence of odorant receptors
on device channels post-functionalisation, ORs were tagged with green
fluorescent protein and fluorescence microscope images taken. The
functionalised channels showed significantly more green fluorescence
than the control. This result indicates protein attachment to the
channel is not limited to empty nanodiscs. As far as the author is
aware, this is the first time fluorescence has been used to verify the
presence of odorant receptors on a carbon nanotube network.

However, the use of the functionalisation procedure with PBASE in
methanol and OR22a in nanodiscs was not readily reproducible. A repeat
of the functionalisation procedure and sensing procedure across six
different device channels showed no decrease in current subsequent to
additions ranging from 1 fM to 1 µM. Further control testing indicated
that the successful sensing seen earlier was not spurious, meaning that
the lack of reproducibility could be attributed to the functionalisation
procedure. Device characterisation showed that although nanodiscs
appeared to be present on the channel, with a change in network height
above the substrate of up to \(\sim\) 20 nm relative to a pristine film,
the average threshold shift was \(-0.06\pm0.02\) V, the same as that of
a device functionalised using PBASE in methanol without subsequent
exposure to nanodiscs. A control taken without using PBASE also showed
nanodiscs present on the channel, with a change in network height above
the substrate of up to \(\sim\) 10 nm relative to a pristine film, but
resulted in a threshold shift of \(\sim\) -0.27 V. It therefore appears
that nanodiscs are sometimes being blocked from attaching to the carbon
nanotube network in a manner that alters the electrical characteristics
of the carbon nanotube network.

Potential confounding variables identified in the functionalisation
process included coatings of surfactant, solvent, photoresist,
multilayered or hydrolysed PBASE, and the atmospheric long-chain alkanes
which cause carbon nanotube hydrophobicity. Several possible confounding
variables were individually eliminated by making slight changes to the
fabrication and functionalisation of the device. Neither hanging the
morphology of the carbon nanotube network and using a graphene device
led to consistent negative current responses. Furthermore, the average
threshold shift for the highly-bundled device after functionalisation
was \(−0.02\pm0.01\) V, indicating a lack of electrical contact between
the channel and nanodiscs even without surfactant present. By changing
the solvent used for functionalisation from methanol to DMSO, the
average threshold shift was \(−0.22\pm0.03\) V, which demonstrates
electrical contact with the nanodiscs. However, no negative current
changes were observed subsequent to analyte additions, suggesting
multiple confounding factors are at play. To ensure that the hygroscopic
DMSO was not hydrolysing the PBASE and preventing odorant receptor
attachment, a PBA with EDC/NHS functionalisation method was used.
However, the average threshold shift observed was \(-0.12\pm0.01\) V,
similar to the -0.15 V shift seen for attachment of PBA to DMSO without
subsequent modification. The confounding factor is therefore not
resolved by either changing the solvent or preventing hydrolysis.

The remaining possible sources of surface contamination, including
alkane hydrocarbons, multilayer linker and photoresist, were then
addressed by making significant changes to the functionalisation
procedure. To avoid multilayer coverage, pyrene-PEG-biotin was attached
to avi-tagged odorant receptors before functionalisation. To remove
hydrocarbons and residual photoresist, the transducer device was gently
oxygen plasma cleaned before functionalisation. Furthermore, no
nanodiscs were used, to ensure direct attachment of odorant receptors.
Although there are also issues with reliable reproducibility of this
method due to the plasma cleaning step, when a device was functionalised
with OR10a in this manner, device current decreases of up to \(\sim\)
24\% were observed in response to methyl salicylate additions. It
appears the long-term baseline drift was affected by the
functionalisation of the device, where the linear approximation used was
relatively weak.

This aqueous functionalisation approach was also used for vapour sensing
with OR35a odorant receptors. Clear responses consistent with those seen
in an aqueous environment were not observed. The changes in current seen
appear more likely to result from a breakdown of the linear
approximation of baseline drift for functionalised devices, or from
increased non-specific sensitivity of the device post-functionalisation.
It was concluded that reproducible vapour sensing would require either a
robust covalent functionalisation method which used a protective
membrane-like format, or alternatively from using a capture layer to
protect non-covalently odorant receptors from the harsh chamber
environment. However, it was found 0.5\% v/v DMSO \(1 \times\) PBS could
not act as this capture layer due to rapid evaporation of the layer
having a significant effect on baseline drift from \(\sim\) 800 s
onwards. An alternative liquid should therefore be identified which is
biofriendly and miscible while having a low vapour pressure. It should
also repel PDMS, to remain contained in the PDMS well upside down in the
device chamber. These approaches significantly expand the scope of this
work, and are therefore not addressed extensively in this thesis.
However, some preliminary work on alternative approaches is discussed in
\textbf{?@sec-future-work}.

force microscope and processed in Gwyddion (see
\textbf{?@sec-afm-characterisation}). It was originally designed by
Erica Happe in Matlab, and adapted by Marissa Dierkes and myself for use
in Python. The code imports the .xyz data and sorts it into bins 0.15 nm

The purpose of this code is to analyse a series of Raman spectra taken
at different points on a single film (see
\textbf{?@sec-raman-characterisation}). Data is imported in a series of
tab-delimited text files, with the low wavenumber spectrum (100

\section{Field-Effect Transistor

The purpose of this code is to analyse electrical measurements taken of
field-effect transistor (FET) devices. Electrical measurements were
either taken from the Keysight 4156C Semiconductor Parameter Analyser,
National Instruments NI-PXIe or Keysight B1500A Semiconductor Device
Analyser as discussed in \textbf{?@sec-electrical-characterisation}; the
code is able to analyse data in .csv format taken from all three
measurement setups. The main Python file in the code base consists of
three related but independent modules: the first analyses and plots
sensing data from the FET devices, the second analyses and plots
transfer characteristics from channels across a device, and the third
compares individual channel characteristics before and after a
modification or after each of several modifications. The code base also
features a separate config file and style sheet which govern the
behaviour of the main code. The code base was designed collaboratively
by myself and Erica Cassie over GitHub using the Sourcetree Git GUI.
