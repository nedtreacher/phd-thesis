\section{General Remarks}\label{general-remarks}}

Through the adaptation of an existing setup, a custom vapour delivery
system was developed to measure the response of field-effect biosensors
to vapour. To achieve this goal, the new system needed to meet three
requirements:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The ability to automatically deliver a vapour to an enclosed
  environment in a controlled manner.
\item
  The ability to collect measurements from a sensor device within that
  environment.
\item
  The ability to collect data from off-the-shelf reference sensors
  monitoring the same environment, for comparison with data collected by
  the novel biosensor.
\end{itemize}

The existing system had a limited ability to meet the first two
requirements, but was not able to take reference measurements of vapour
flow. To implement new elements that would enable the system to fulfill
all three requirements, a two-step development approach was taken across
the course of the thesis. The changes made with each step of the
redesign are outlined in Section~\ref{sec-vapour-system-design}.

Three mass flow controllers (MFC) were used to precisely control and
monitor the flow of nitrogen into the system in units of standard cubic
centimeters per minute (sccm). The manner in which these controllers
were configured in the system is discussed in
Section~\ref{sec-delivery-system}. The reference sensors chosen were a
photoionisation detector (Ametek Mocon) and relative humidity and
temperature indicator (Telaire). The photoionisation detector is able to
monitor a wide range of volatile organic compounds, but cannot monitor
compounds with an ionisation energy exceeding 10.6 eV. This includes
nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, argon and water
\autocite{PIDmanual,Ionscience}. Therefore, the photoionisation detector
(PID) should not respond to either ambient air or standard nitrogen flow
through the detector. As we would also like to monitor the presence of
water vapour in the system, we use a relative humidity indicator (RHI).
The operation of these reference sensors is discussed further in
Section~\ref{sec-reference-sensors}.

\end{figure}

Three mass flow controller and their associated regulators sit in an
covered enclosure, seen from the front in
Figure~\ref{fig-mass-flow-controller-layout}. These are used to control
the nitrogen flow rate through two different lines towards the chamber,
the carrier line and dilution line. The lines merge at a mixing point
about a metre before the device chamber, which contains the device being
analysed. Each line consist of a mix of stainless steel and flexible PVC
tubing, with various Swagelok fittings and valves. These valves include
check valves, to ensure there is no backflow of vapour within the
system. The carrier line connects flow to a 10 mL Schott bottle (Duran)
containing analyte, shown in Figure~\ref{fig-analyte-bottle}. The vapour
from the volatile analyte is then carried by nitrogen flow through the
carrier line. A three-way valve determines whether the analyte vapour is
then carried towards the mixing point or sent into the fumehood via the
exhaust. The dilution line separately delivers flow to the mixing point,
modifying the flow pushing the analyte vapour towards the chamber.

The setup is designed so that only one mass flow controller is directed
through a single line at a time. The mass flow controller with a
full-scale flow of 500 sccm (standard cubic centimeters per minute) can
only be directed through the dilution line, and the mass flow controller
with a full-scale flow of 20 sccm can only be directed through the
carrier line. The mass flow controller with a full-scale flow of 200
sccm can be directed through the dilution line or carrier line. The
electronic integration and programming of the mass flow controllers is
described in Section~\ref{sec-control-system}.

\end{figure}

Two reference sensors were added to the vapour delivery setup to compare
the response to vapour by the fabricated sensor device with some
reference signal. These reference sensors are a photoionisation detector
(Ametek Mocon) and a relative humidity and temperature indicator
(Telaire). The layout of these reference sensors (and their associated
peripherals) relative to the device chamber is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-reference-sensor-layout}. These components are on a
raised platform directly above the mass flow controller enclosure.
Vapour flowing through the device chamber passes into a cylindrical
manifold with three outlets. One outlet is the system exhaust, one flows
into relative humidity indicator chamber, and one flows into the
photoionisation detector. A dial-controlled micro diaphragm pump is used
to set the flow rate from the manifold into the photoionisation
detector, with a flowmeter used to monitor this flow rate.

The electronic integration and programming of the relative humidity and
temperature indicator is described in Section~\ref{sec-control-system}.
The photoionisation detector was connected to a laptop directly via USB,
then controlled and monitored using the supplier-provided VOC-TRAQ II
software package.

\hypertarget{relative-humidity-and-temperature-indicator}{%
\subsubsection*{Relative Humidity and Temperature
Indicator}\label{relative-humidity-and-temperature-indicator}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Relative Humidity and Temperature
Indicator}

The relative humidity and temperature indicator used here is a
capacitive humidity sensor \autocite{Telairesensor}. It consists of a
capacitor with a hygroscopic polymer as the capacitor dielectric. As
room temperature water has a much larger dielectric constant than the
polymer dielectric, absorption of water by the polymer leads to
increased sensor capacitance \autocite{capacitivesensor}. The sensor
capacitance, corresponding to the amount of moisture absorbed by the
polymer and therefore the relative humidity, is then translated by the
sensor into a calibrated electronic output. This output is then
processed using the hardware and software described in
Section~\ref{sec-control-system} to give a value for the relative
humidity. The sensor has a quoted relative humidity (RH) accuracy of
\(\pm 2.0\)\% when RH is below 80\%, and has a quoted temperature
accuracy of \(0.5^\circ\)C \autocite{Telairesensor}.

The absolute humidity (AH), the mass of water vapour within a set
volume, can be calculated in gm\(^{-3}\) using
Equation~\ref{eq-absolute-humidity}, where \(C = 2.16679\) gKJ\(^{-1}\),
\(P_W\) is the water vapour pressure (in Pa) and T is the temperature
(in K) \autocite{humidityformula}.

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-absolute-humidity}{}{
AH = C\frac{P_W}{T}
}\label{eq-absolute-humidity}\end{equation}

For temperatures between -20\(^\circ\)C and 50\(^\circ\)C, water vapour
pressure \(P_W\) (in hPa) can be approximated using
Equation~\ref{eq-water-vapour-pressure}, where RH is relative humidity,
T is temperature in \(^\circ\)C, \(A = 6.116441\) hPa, \(m = 7.591386\)
and \(T_{n} = 240.7263^\circ\)C \autocite{humidityformula}.

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-water-vapour-pressure}{}{
P_W = RH \times A \times 10^{(mT/(T+T_{n}))}
}\label{eq-water-vapour-pressure}\end{equation}

\hypertarget{photoionisation-detector}{%
\subsubsection*{Photoionisation
Detector}\label{photoionisation-detector}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Photoionisation Detector}

A photoionisation detector (PID) can be used to continuously monitor
volatile organic compounds by measuring the extent to which vapour
molecules passing through the detector can be ionised. A small
percentage of vapour molecules flowing into the detector diffuse into a
sensor cavity. This cavity is bounded on each side by a pair of
electrodes. A lamp in the body of the detector radiates UV light through
a window into this cavity. The vapour molecules have their outer-most
electrons excited and removed when struck with these high-energy
photons. The ionised molecules then drift towards the sensor cathode,
while free electrons drift towards the sensor anode. This results in a
current proportional to the concentration of vapour molecules in the
chamber. The current can then be amplified for a signal readout. To be
detected, the ionisation energy of the molecules being monitored cannot
exceed the energy of the incident UV light. Therefore, molecules of
clean air will not be detected. Likewise, volatile organic compounds
with high ionisation energy \(-\) such as methane \(-\) will not be
recognised by the PID. Conversely, if the energy is required to ionise a
volatile of interest is relatively low, the PID will generally show a
relatively large response to that volatile
\autocite{Ionscience,PIDmanual}.

The photoionisation detector used in this work had a lamp energy of 10.6
eV, with a quoted response time of less than 2 seconds. Photoionisation
detectors are designed to sensitively detect within a particular
concentration range. PID sensors can become less sensitive after being
exposed to very high concentrations of volatile gas. They can also
become less sensitive if exposed to high levels of humidity or volatile
substances known to contaminate the PID window, which are not used in
this thesis. The typical sensitivity range of a PID can be stated in
terms of the sensor response to isobutylene gas, which is typically used
to calibrate PID sensors. The sensitivity of the the PID sensor used
here was 10 ppb \(-\) 200 ppm. Calibration with a reference gas ensures
the detector reads the true concentration of volatiles being detected,
multiplied by some previously-documented factor called a ``response
factor''. However, these response factors can vary based on the design
of the PID and various environmental factors
\autocite{Ionscience,PIDmanual}.

In this work, the PID was operated without end-user calibration. PID
measurements were used to confirm the evolution of vapour presence in
the chamber over time. It should be expected that sensor sensitivity
will exhibit span drift over days or weeks, depending on changes in the
local environment, and therefore measurements should not be treated as
absolute measurements that correspond to a true concentration reading. A
sampling rate of 1 s was used for all measurements. When sampling vapour
concentration, baseline measurements of nitrogen flow through the PID
were used as the zero concentration reference point.

The vapour of interest can be delivered to the PID either through
diffusion or by means of a low-power pump. A micro diaphragm pump
(Xavitech) was selected to pump the vapour from the chamber into the PID
detector. A pump with a low maximum flow rate was selected since the PID
requires a inlet flow of less than 300 sccm. As the pump is controlled
using a unlabelled dial, a flowmeter was used to independently measure
the flow rate through the micropump into the PID.

\hypertarget{sec-control-system}{%
\subsection{Control System}\label{sec-control-system}}

The vapour delivery system was controlled and monitored from a laptop
connected to a National Instruments USB-6009 multifunction data
acquisition input/ output module (DAQ). This USB-6009 DAQ connected to
the mass flow controllers and relative humidity and temperature
indicator (Telaire) via a custom-designed circuit board manufactured by
PCBway. The outputs and inputs of the USB-6009 DAQ were set using custom
LabView software. These electronic and software components of the vapour
delivery control system are described in more detail below. The
photoionisation detector (Ametek Mocon) was controlled from the same
laptop with its own prepackaged software (VOC-TRAQ II).

\end{figure}

The control circuit board used to connect the mass flow controllers and
relative humidity and temperature indicator to the NI USB-6009 is shown
in Figure~\ref{fig-vapour-sensor-pcb}. Only one mass flow controller can
be set to provide flow to a specific line, and so only two mass flow
controllers can be operational simultaneously during testing with the
vapour delivery system. The control circuit board allows the user to set
which two mass flow controllers are to be used during a specific test
run. Figure~\ref{fig-vapour-sensor-pcb} (a) shows the ``high-flow''
configuration, where the 500 sccm full-scale MFC is connected to the

humidity indicator, and the power supply for the MFCs.

Two LabView Virtual Instruments (VIs) were adapted from pre-existing VIs
for operating the mass flow controllers and monitoring vapour flow into
the device chamber, as well as monitoring temperature and humidity in
the vapour delivery system's manifold. These VIs were named
``vapour-sensor-basic.vi'' and ``temp-and-humidity-basic.vi''. A third
VI was developed in parallel which combined the first two Virtual
Instruments and allowed the user to set a sequence of values for the
output flow from the mass flow controllers before an experimental run.
This VI was named ``vapour-sensor-sequence-timestamped.vi''. Flow rate,
relative humidity and temperature data were then saved as .lvm files.
The LabView VIs described here are available on request.

\end{figure}

The initial design of the vapour delivery system, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-original-pid}, was relatively simple. No reference
sensors were included in the setup, and only one channel could be
characterised without opening the chamber and changing the position of
the device. However, as constructed it worked well as a self-contained
system, which was able to deliver vapour to a device channel while
measuring current across the channel. The original system is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-original-setup}, and the circuit board used to control
it is shown in@fig-original-pcb A 500 sccm full-range MFC (Tylan) was
placed on the dilution line, and a 200 sccm full-range MFC (Tylan) was
placed on the carrier line. A glass container for analyte was present on
the carrier line, with a vapour trap upstream to collect any backflow.
The vapour trap was removed in later iterations due to the presence of a
check valve to prevent backflow. The device chamber and mass flow
controllers were connected to a laptop and an Agilent 4156C
semiconductor parameter analyser and controlled using LabView.

\caption{\label{fig-stage-1-pid}P\&ID of the Stage I vapour delivery
system.}

\end{figure}

The first stage of the vapour delivery system redesign, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-stage-1-pid}, was implemented in Nov 2021. This system
introduced the ability to use a 20 sccm full-range MFC (MKS Instruments)
for carrier line flow and a 200 sccm full-range MFC (MKS Instruments)
for either carrier or dilution line flow, to give better control when
using low flow rates. The reference sensors were also implemented, with
each sensor connected in parallel to the chamber exhaust. Through
testing the system with ethanol and acetone as analytes, the following
issues with this implementation of the setup were identified:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  With the system connected to the lab supply of nitrogen, pressure
  changes in the line due to nitrogen use elsewhere in the lab impacted
  the pressure at the MFCs and the flow through the lines.
\item
  The pressure indicator used for the device chamber had a much wider
  range than the pressure reached before nitrogen began to leak out of
  the PVC tubing; this meant pressure changes in the chamber, resulting
  from closing the exit valves while nitrogen flow entered the chamber,
  did not register on the indicator.
\item
  The PID responded unexpectedly slowly to changes in vapour
  concentration in the chamber. For example, after acetone or ethanol
  vapour had been run through the chamber, running clean nitrogen
  through the system for 3 hours was required before the PID returned to
  a constant baseline reading.
\item
  There was no way to ensure the device chamber was free of analyte
  vapour before an experimental run aside from running nitrogen through
  the dilution line. After prolonged use, condensed analyte was
  sometimes visible in the PVC lines of the delivery system.
\end{itemize}

These issues, along with various minor structural and design issues,
were addressed in the second-stage implementation of the system.

design for the vapour delivery system setup. This stage of the redesign
was implemented between Jan and May 2022. Changes from the first stage
included:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The addition of a N\(_2\) cylinder (152D size) as the source of
  nitrogen for the system to replace the lab supply.
\item
  A pressure indicator with a lower pressure range was used, which could
  register pressure changes within the device chamber.
\item
  A chamber manifold was placed before the exhaust with outlets into the
  PID and RHI.
\item
  A micro diaphragm pump was introduced between the manifold and PID to
  supply the PID with vapour from the chamber, and a flowmeter was
  placed before the pump to measure the flow rate out of the chamber to
  the PID. The PID was then seen to respond quickly to system changes
  (discussed further in Section~\ref{sec-calibration}).
\item
  A piece of PVC tubing was placed at the PID outlet to limit air from
  the fumehood entering the PID when the micropump was off.
\item
  Valves were placed before all system components so that the device
  chamber and post-analyte bottle carrier line could be evacuated with a
  roughing pump without potentially affecting components.
\item
  Check valves were placed at the exhaust to prevent backflow from the
  roughing pump into the delivery system.
\end{itemize}

These changes largely addressed the issues identified in
Section~\ref{sec-vapour-system-design-1}.

flow controllers using the water displacement method.}

\end{figure}

A water displacement test was carried out to determine the relationship
between the flow rate measured by the mass flow controllers and the
actual flow rate passing through the chamber. All valves were set so
that both the dilution and carrier lines followed a single path. Both
these paths went through the device chamber and out through the system
exhaust. An empty analyte bottle was placed on the carrier line. The
system exhaust was placed into a bucket filled with tap water, with the
outlet sitting beneath an upturned 500 mL measurement cylinder, as
pictured in Figure~\ref{fig-water-displacement}. The cylinder was used
to measure the volume of displaced water over time, which is equivalent
to the rate of change of nitrogen volume entering the cylinder from the
exhaust. As leaks in the manifold and exhaust line were not detected
when leak testing with bubble solution, it can be safely assumed that
the rate at which nitrogen exits the exhaust is equivalent to the
nitrogen flow rate through the device chamber.

200 sccm full-scale MFC through the carrier line (a) and the 500 sccm
full-scale MFC through the dilution line (b).}

\end{figure}

The time taken to displace a fixed volume of water was measured three
times for a series of constant flow rates, both for the 200 sccm MFC
(MKS) on the carrier line and the 500 sccm MFC (Tylan) on the dilution
line. The displacement flow rate corresponding to each measurement could
then be found by dividing volume by time. These measurements, of
displacement flow relative to nominal flow through the MFC, are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-MFC-calibration-curves}. The flow through the chamber
was offset from the nominal flow reading from the mass flow controllers,
with a strong linear relationship between the two measurements. A linear
least-squares fit was performed, where coefficients \(a_1\) and \(a_2\)
were found for the linear relationship \(D = a_1d + a_2\), where \(d\)
is nominal flow from the MFC and \(D\) is measured displacement flow. A
95\% confidence interval for each fit was also obtained. For the 200
sccm MFC flow through the carrier line, values of \(a_1 = 1.14\pm0.07\)
and \(a_2 = -6\pm8\) were obtained, while for the 500 sccm MFC flow
through the dilution line, values of \(a_1 = 1.14\pm0.06\) and
\(a_2 = -6\pm16\) were obtained.

It appears that the offset between the measured displacement flow and
nominal output flow is not due to leaks in the system, since the offset
indicates measured flow exceeds the nominal flow. Instead, the offset
appears to be a systematic error introduced by the electronics or
software used to record the output flow from the MFCs. The identical
offset between measured and nominal flow observed for each MFC, even
when placed on different lines to the chamber, further strengthens the
likelihood of the offset being due to the control side of the system.
Furthermore, due to the identical offset for each of the carrier and
dilution MFCs, the same offset should apply to a mixture of flows on
each line. For example, a 200 sccm nominal flow through the dilution
line from the 500 sccm full-scale MFC should have a roughly identical
actual flow rate to a 50 sccm nominal flow through the dilution line and
a 150 sccm flow through the carrier line. In this work, tests performed
with the vapour delivery system have flow rate stated in terms of their
nominal value, but the reader should keep in mind the \(1.14 \times\)
offset from the actual chamber flow.

\caption{\label{fig-flowmeter-calibration}Calibration curve for the PID
flowmeter, comparing flowmeter readings with flow rate of water
displacement.}

\end{figure}

The time taken to displace a fixed water volume was also measured three
times for a series of constant flow rates through the flowmeter from the
chamber to exhaust. A linear relationship was obtained between flowmeter
readings and actual displacement, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-flowmeter-calibration}. Expressing the relationship as
\(D = b_1f + b_2\), where \(f\) is the flowmeter reading and \(D\) is
measured displacement flow, values of \(b_1 = 1.0\pm0.2\) and
\(b_2 = 80\pm25\) were obtained. A 200 sccm flow rate through the
dilution line from the Tylan MFC, corresponding to a \(\sim\) 230 sccm
actual flow rate through the chamber, would therefore be measured as a
\(\sim\) 150 sccm flow rate by the flowmeter. Subsequent measurements
showed that the linear relationship in
Figure~\ref{fig-flowmeter-calibration} breaks down for flowmeter
readings \(\lesssim 75\). For example, a 50 sccm flow on the flowmeter
was found to correspond to 85 sccm of measured displacement flow. By
disconnecting the flowmeter from the PID micropump and closing all
valves out of the manifold except the valve exiting to the flowmeter
(see Figure~\ref{fig-stage-2-pid}), the nominal flow on the MFC could be
directly compared to the flowmeter reading. In this manner, the actual
flow rate of readings \(\lesssim 75\) sccm on the flowmeter could be
quickly obtained.

indicator or straight to the fumehood. This diagram assumes that flow
through leaks in the chamber and manifold is low enough to be considered
negligible, which was confirmed by leak testing with bubble solution.}

\end{figure}

Once the rate of flow through the device chamber had been calibrated,
the next step was to verify the correct operation of the reference
sensors used in the system. Various flow rates in and out of the chamber
were used to calibrate and verify the reference sensors. These flows in
and out of the chamber are labelled on the simplified schematic in
Figure~\ref{fig-chamber-schematic}.

line and carrier lines of the vapour system, with 10 mL deionised water

\end{figure}

To test the relative humidity indicator (RHI), all valves out of the
chamber were sealed except for the valve for the relative humidity
indicator chamber. This meant all flow coming out of the system would
pass through the relative humidity indicator chamber (P = 0 sccm and
exhaust goes to RHI in Figure~\ref{fig-chamber-schematic}). Continuous
nitrogen flow was then placed through the chamber until relative
humidity dropped to about 20\%. 10 mL of deionised water was placed into
the analyte bottle. A series of different flow rates through each line
was sent to the chamber, with the sequence of flow rates shown in
Table~\ref{tbl-RHI-flow-sequence} (t = time, C = carrier line flow rate,
D = dilution line flow rate). Note that between 230 s and 630 s, the
total flow rate remains the same, but the ratio of dilution to carrier
flow differs.

\end{longtable}

Figure~\ref{fig-RHI-verification} shows flow purely from the dilution
line decreases humidity as measured by the Telaire sensor, while flow
from the analyte bottle containing deionised water increases humidity,
as expected. It also shows that in regular 200 s intervals, an uptick in
the increase of relative humidity occurs, which then begins to flatten
out. Each gradient uptick occurs about 50 s after a corresponding
increase in flow through the carrier line. It therefore appears that
each interval corresponds to an increase of water vapour flow, where 50
s is the time taken for the increased concentration of water vapour to
first reach the relative humidity indicator.

Over the full 800 s of carrier line flow, relative humidity increases
from a minimum of \(14.0\pm2.0\)\% to a maximum of \(43.6\pm2.0\)\%. The
temperature in the chamber remained between \(21.0\pm0.5^\circ\)C and
\(22.0\pm0.5^\circ\)C over the entire measurement period. Combining
equations Equation~\ref{eq-absolute-humidity} and
Equation~\ref{eq-water-vapour-pressure} from
Section~\ref{sec-reference-sensors}, we find that the absolute humidity
in the chamber reaches a low of \(2.6\pm0.4\) gm\(^{-3}\) at 238.1 s,
38.1 s after the initial onset of carrier flow, and a high of
\(8.4\pm0.5\) gm\(^{-3}\) at 998.8 s, after 798.8 s of carrier flow
through the chamber. The clear response of the Telaire RHI to water
vapour flow through the carrier line confirms that this sensor is
working as expected.

\hypertarget{photoionisation-detector-1}{%
\subsubsection*{Photoionisation
Detector}\label{photoionisation-detector-1}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Photoionisation Detector}

To test the photoionisation detector, the device chamber and carrier
line were first purged of vapour through the exhaust using a roughing
pump, with the PID valve closed to protect it from the pump. The PID
valve was then opened, the micropump was set to 150 sccm as read by the
flowmeter. During testing with the PID, the total flow into the chamber
was set at 200 sccm as read by the Tylan mass flow controllers. The
calibration curves in Section~\ref{sec-flow-calibration} show that the
actual flow C + D was then therefore approximately the same as the
actual flow rate into the PID, P. A flow of 200 sccm nitrogen was placed
through the dilution line to the chamber for 10 minutes until successive
concentration readings from the PID were either approximately constant,
or until baseline drift was small enough to be considered negligible.
These measurements were then used as the baseline (0 ppm) for subsequent
measurements. 5 mL of the volatile organic compound ethyl hexanoate
(EtHex) was placed into the analyte bottle. A flow of 150 sccm was then
sent through the carrier line and 50 sccm through the dilution line for
600 s. The same procedure was performed on two separate dates spaced
three days apart (23 Feb and 26 Feb) to check that the measured PID
response to ethyl hexanoate vapour pumped out of the manifold was
repeatable.

\caption{\label{fig-PID-EtHex-response}The response of the
photoionisation detector to ethyl hexanoate vapour over 600 s of
exposure is shown relative to the 200 sccm nitrogen flow baseline in
(a), and normalised with respect to the maximum reading in (b).}

\end{figure}

The responses from each date are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-PID-EtHex-response}. In
Figure~\ref{fig-PID-EtHex-response} (a), the response corresponding to
each measurement date is shown unnormalised, with the parts per million
concentration shown relative to the nitrogen baseline as recorded by the
PID. Both measurements show little to no response to vapour for
approximately 50 s, which seems to be the time taken for vapour to first
reach the PID. Over the next 100s, there is a rapid increase in vapour
concentration detected, which then settles to a constant concentration
at about 300 s. This appears to be the maximum concentration of EtHex
vapour that can be contained by the chamber in this configuration. There
is approximately a 200 parts per billion difference in maximum
concentration between the measurement on each date.

However, this is not unexpected. As discussed in
Section~\ref{sec-reference-sensors}, the PID is being run uncalibrated,
and some drift of the sensitivity of the sensor due to environmental
changes is highly likely. To check that the PID records the same
evolution of vapour flow with time, regardless of its sensitivity, the
measurements from both dates were then normalised with respect to the
maximum concentration reading. Figure~\ref{fig-PID-EtHex-response} (b)
shows that once normalised, the rate of change in concentration with
time is almost identical between the two measurement sets. This test
verifies that the evolution of vapour concentration of the device
chamber can be repeatably measured using the PID in the vapour delivery
system.

length. During each input interval, 150 sccm carrier flow and 50 sccm
dilution flow was placed through the chamber.}

\end{figure}

A further series of tests were performed to verify whether it was
possible to compare different concentrations of vapour in the chamber
using the PID. All testing was performed on the same day to minimise
sensitivity drift. For each test, the system was purged of vapour and
the total dilution flow into the chamber was set at 200 sccm as read by
the Tylan mass flow controller. Flow out of the chamber to the PID was
set at 100 sccm as read by the micropump flowmeter, and the
almost-constant nitrogen baseline after 10 minutes was set as the PID
zero point. 5 mL of the volatile organic compound ethyl hexanoate
(EtHex) was placed into the analyte bottle. During each test, 200 sccm
was continuously flowed through the dilution line, except during three
evenly spaced intervals of equal length. During these intervals, 150
sccm flow was placed through the carrier line and 50 sccm flow placed
through the dilution line. In each test, the input interval time was
varied to examine its effect on maximum vapour concentration recorded by
the PID. As it took longer for the PID to return to a constant baseline
with increased input intervals, when the input interval was increased,
the spacing between intervals was also increased.

The results of three tests, with input intervals of 50 s, 100 s and 200
s, are shown in Figure~\ref{fig-concentration-comparison}. Each interval
of carrier flow corresponds to a rapid increase in concentration, which
reaches a peak, then decreases. The maximum concentration reached for
each interval is shown above the corresponding peak. Note that the
maximum concentration label does not correspond to the difference
between the original baseline and the maximum concentration of each
peak. Instead, it corresponds to the difference between the
concentration measurement at a set time before the onset of carrier flow
and the maximum concentration reached. For each test, this set time is
5\% of the spacing time used, 50 s, 150 s and 300 s respectively. This
approach was taken to account for what appears to be drift from the
original 0 ppm baseline. This variable baseline drift was particularly
significant for the 100 s interval measurements, where concentration
measurements settled to a new baseline of \(\sim\) 0.05 ppm after the
third peak.

The values of three concentration maxima in each test are highly
consistent, with only a \(\pm\) 0.02 ppm margin of error. This
experiment demonstrates that if tests using the PID are performed during
the same day, placing the same vapour flow into the PID for the same
interval of time in each test, it is possible to measure the same
maximum concentration with the PID. It furthermore indicates that the
placing the same amount of vapour flow into the chamber for a set amount
of time leads to a reproducible concentration of vapour building up
within the chamber.

\hypertarget{summary}{%
\section{Summary}\label{summary}}

A custom vapour delivery system was made suitable for field-effect
biosensor work through ensuring a range of flows could be delivered
through the system and that reference sensors were available for
corroboration with the readings on the field-effect biosensors. Two new
mass flow controllers with different maximum flow rates and two
reference sensors, a relative humidity and temperature sensor and
photoionisation detector, were introduced to the system in a two-stage
design process. A new electronic control system and LabView software
were designed and constructed for the altered delivery system. The
nitrogen flow through the system was then calibrated using water
displacement testing, and it was verified that the reference sensors
both worked as expected.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

A range of methods were followed to fabricate carbon nanotube network
and graphene field-effect transistors for biosensor use. This chapter
therefore looks to use the characterisation techniques outlined in the
previous chapter to compare and contrast the device channel morphologies
and electrical characteristics resulting from various methods.

The three carbon nanotube film types used for devices were the
solvent-deposited, surfactant-deposited and steam-assisted
surfactant-deposited (steam-deposited) films discussed in the previous
chapter. As minor changes were made to fabrication processes throughout
the thesis, the fabrication dates of devices used are stated, which can
be cross-referenced with \textbf{?@sec-fabrication} to identify the
specific process used. Atomic force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy
was performed on the carbon nanotube networks to identify the
distribution of carbon nanotube diameters and the defects present on the
carbon nanotube networks. Electrical characterisation was then used to
see how the morphology of each film type affects the performance of the
completed devices. Both back-gated and liquid-gated transfer
characteristics were compared, as well as key parameters taken from the
liquid-gated characteristics. The electrical behaviour of liquid-gated
graphene devices was also examined, as well as the impact of water on
the performance of back-gated devices for vapour sensing use.

Finally, as a control measurement for liquid-gated sensing and to verify
the behaviour of the pristine device as a sensor, a salt concentration
sensing series was performed with a steam-deposited carbon nanotube
network device. The device characteristics were taken and device drift
was examined and modelled. The sensing series was performed by
successively diluting 1XPBS electrolyte in the polydimethylsiloxane
`well' (electrolyte container) while passing a current through the
device, and measuring the current response to dilutions. Various filters
were applied to the collected data to better understand the signal
change.

Figure~\ref{fig-afm-morphology} shows a side-by-side comparison of the
surface morphology of carbon nanotube films fabricated using the methods
described in \textbf{?@sec-dep-carbon-nanotubes}. These images were
collected using an atomic force microscope and processed in the manner
described in \textbf{?@sec-afm-characterisation}.
Figure~\ref{fig-bundled-network} shows a film of carbon nanotubes
deposited in solvent, Figure~\ref{fig-dropcast-network} shows a film of
carbon nanotubes dropcast in surfactant, and
Figure~\ref{fig-steaming-network} shows carbon nanotubes dropcast in
surfactant in the presence of steam. As discussed in previous works
using solvent-based deposition techniques for depositing carbon
nanotubes, in each network multi-tube bundles form due to strong mutual
attraction between nanotubes
\autocite{Zheng2017,Murugathas2018,Murugathas2019a,Nguyen2021}. However,
when surfactants are present, they adsorb onto the carbon nanotubes and
form a highly repulsive structure able to overcome the strong attraction
between nanotubes. This repulsion keeps the individual carbon nanotubes
more isolated
\autocite{Wenseleers2004,Gavrel2013,Hermanson2013-16,Shimizu2013,DiCrescenzo2014}.
The diameter range provided by the supplier for the individual carbon
nanotubes used is \(1.2-1.7\) nm, while the length range is \(0.3-5.0\)
\(\mu\)m (Nanointegris).

It has previously been demonstrated that the diameter range of deposited
single-walled carbon nanotubes can be modelled via a normal or Gaussian
distribution \autocite{LeMieux2008,Liu2013,Vobornik2023}. However, when
the height profiles from the 2.5 \(\mu\)m \(\times\) 2.5 \(\mu\)m AFM
images are directly extracted and binned, as plotted in black in
Figure~\ref{fig-afm-morphology}, the histograms obtained do not follow a
normal distribution. One reason for this result is the surface roughness
of the silicon dioxide substrate. The carbon nanotubes do not lie
perfectly level on a perfectly level silicon oxide substrate. In
practice, both the SiO\(_2\) substrate and the surface of the carbon
nanotubes both have a degree of roughness. To find the contribution of
surface roughness to the height profile histogram corresponding to each
network deposition method, silicon dioxide substrates were modified
using the same processes as in Figure~\ref{fig-afm-morphology} but
without carbon nanotubes present in the solutions used. 2.5 \(\mu\)m
\(\times\) 2.5 \(\mu\)m AFM images of the modified surfaces are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-afm-substrate}.

\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig-afm-substrate}, it appears that each substrate
surface has a roughness that follows a normal distribution with some
degree of skewness. Figure~\ref{fig-sio2-histogram} and
Figure~\ref{fig-surfactant-histogram} are negatively skewed
distributions. The fitted skew-normal distribution in
Figure~\ref{fig-sio2-histogram} has a skew parameter \(\alpha\) (or
shape parameter) of -3.2, a location parameter \(\xi\) of 2.2 nm and a
scale parameter \(\omega\) of 0.5 nm, while in
Figure~\ref{fig-surfactant-histogram} \(\alpha = -2.2\), \(\xi = 2.2\)
nm and \(\omega = 0.5\) nm. \(\xi\) and \(\omega\) correspond to the
mean and standard deviation of the skew-free normal distribution when
\(\alpha\) is set equal to zero \autocite{Azzalini1999}. The close
correspondence between \(\xi\) and \(\omega\) for these distributions
but not \(\alpha\) implies that the skewness is a variable imaging or
processing artifact rather than a physical property of the surface.
Without distortion, the roughness of a clean SiO\(_2\) surface should
follow a normal distribution \autocite{Velicky2015}.

However, Figure~\ref{fig-steamed-surfactant-histogram} has a pronounced
positive skew with a long tail. The tail appears to result from the
contribution of residual surfactant aggregates to surface morphology,
observed in Figure~\ref{fig-steamed-surfactant} and recently discussed
elsewhere in the literature \autocite{Christensen2022,Vobornik2023}.
Attempting to fit a skew-normal distribution to this histogram fails
when all three variables are allowed to vary due to the presence of the
tail. Instead, previous values obtained for \(\xi\) and \(\omega\) can
be used for the fitting process, with only \(\alpha\) allowed to change.
Fixing \(\xi\) and \(\omega\) at 2.2 nm and 0.5 nm respectively gives
the result shown in Figure~\ref{fig-steamed-surfactant-histogram}. The
fitted distribution has an \(\alpha\) of -2.4. The distribution closely
fits the negative tail of the histogram, but deviates slightly from the
positive tail due to the presence of surfactant. Since this deviation is
small, the quality of the fit is still reasonably high, with an
R-squared value of 0.98. Surfactant contamination could have negative
effects on both sensitivity of carbon nanotubes and also could damage
attached biological elements.

\end{figure}

Using the morphology analysis technique outlined by Vobornik \emph{et
al.} \autocite{Vobornik2023}, five successive diameter measurements of
30 carbon nanotube bundles were collected using Gwyddion. Measurements
were not taken at bundle junctions. A height threshold `mask' was
defined in Gwyddion to determine average substrate height, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-mask}. This background value was subtracted from our
diameter measurements to determine the actual bundle height. The means
of the solvent-deposited, surfactant-deposited and steam-assisted
surfactant-deposited bundle diameter histograms are \(8.8 \pm 4.0\) nm,
\(4.2 \pm 1.8\) nm and \(3.3 \pm 1.0\) nm respectively. An increased
maximum feature height leads to an increased mean background height, and
by examining the AFM images in Figure~\ref{fig-afm-morphology} it
appears this may be due to deep artifacts on the surface of the
substrate in the vicinity of large features. The average of the five
height-adjusted values for each carbon nanotube bundle was then
calculated, and these 30 averages were sorted into six equal-sized bins.
The binned bundle diameter measurements, alongside estimated probability
density, are shown in Figure~\ref{fig-cnt-histogram}.

From Figure~\ref{fig-cnt-histogram}, it is clear that each histogram
appears to follow a positively skewed normal distribution, different to
the skew-free normal distribution expected from previous works
\autocite{LeMieux2008,Liu2013,Vobornik2023}. The skew is likely another
artifact from imaging the network with the atomic force microscope. The
force of the atomic force microscope tip is known to cause larger
bundles to undergo some degree of compression, and the resulting
systematic underestimation of their height may be responsible for the
distribution skewness \autocite{Vobornik2023}. The fitted skew-normal
distribution in Figure~\ref{fig-solvent-cnt-histogram} has
\(\alpha = 2.7\), \(\xi = 4.3\) nm, \(\omega = 5.9\) nm, the
distribution in Figure~\ref{fig-surfactant-cnt-histogram} has
\(\alpha = 2.4\), \(\xi = 2.2\) nm, \(\omega = 2.6\) nm, and the
distribution in Figure~\ref{fig-steamed-surfactant-cnt-histogram} has
\(\alpha = 3.6\), \(\xi = 2.2\) nm and \(\omega = 1.5\) nm. The
probability density for the carbon nanotube bundle histogram drops to
approximately zero at or before 0 nm, which is physically appropriate.

Previously, analysis of the morphology of carbon nanotube networks has
been simplified by assuming the component nanotubes are cylinders,
follow 2D packing and are of equal diameter \autocite{Murugathas2018}.
Table~\ref{tbl-circle-packing} shows the relationship between the
diameter of a bundle of 2D packed cylinders and the constituent
diameters of up to nine cylinders within that bundle. From looking up
the relevant \(d\)/\(d_n\) packing ratios, and assuming an average
carbon nanotube diameter of 1.45 nm, it is possible to use to find the
approximate number of nanotubes \emph{n} likely to be present in the
mean bundle size corresponding to each deposition type
\autocite{Graham1998,Specht2023}. These estimates are shown in
Table~\ref{tbl-histogram-parameters}. Also shown in
Table~\ref{tbl-histogram-parameters} is an estimate of the ratio of
single- to multi-tube bundles for each deposition. This estimate was
obtained by taking the integral of each distribution with a lower bound
of 2.9 nm, the minimum multi-tube bundle size for 1.45 nm diameter
nanotubes. As the area under the curve represents the probability a
bundle will have a particular diameter, this integral should give a good
estimate of the relative proportion of multi-tube bundles.
Table~\ref{tbl-histogram-parameters} should be interpreted as
lower-limit estimates of the size and relative proportion of bundles,
recalling that the distribution skewness indicates underestimation of
the true bundle height.

Both the carbon nanotube bundle diameter mean and standard deviation are
small for surfactant-deposited films when compared to the mean and
standard deviation of solvent-deposited films. However, despite the
presence of surfactant, it is apparent both from
Figure~\ref{fig-afm-morphology} and Table~\ref{tbl-histogram-parameters}
that not all surfactant-dispersed carbon nanotubes are deposited
individually. Bundling may occur during the process of deposition onto
the substrate, which could disrupt the repulsive forces from the
surfactant coating and allow attractive forces to temporarily dominate.
It is possible that the bundling of surfactant-dispersed carbon
nanotubes is a consequence of dynamics introduced by the coffee-ring
effect \autocite{Deegan1997,VanGaalen2021}. The coffee-ring effect
refers to a build-up of dispersed solid forming around the edges of a
dispersion evaporating on a surface. This process occurs due to the
dispersion edges being fixed by surface forces, leading to capillary
flow outwards to replace liquid evaporating at the edges, bringing solid
material along with it. The presence of vapour is known to disrupt this
capillary effect \autocite{Bishop2020}, which may explain why mean
bundle diameter is lower for the films deposited in surfactant with
steam present relative to films deposited in surfactant without steam.

The discussion in this section gives us a new understanding of the
histograms shown in Figure~\ref{fig-afm-morphology}. It is now apparent
that these histograms are linear combinations of skewed normal
distributions. These distributions include a negatively-skewed
distribution corresponding to the substrate surface and a
positively-skewed distribution corresponding to the carbon nanotube
bundles. X and Y junctions between overlapping nanotubes may also form a
similarly skewed normal distribution as part of the full histogram
\autocite{Murugathas2018}. The complete linear combination could be
modelled mathematically in order to rapidly extract key parameters from
atomic force microscope images \autocite{Marchenko2010}, but
implementing this approach is outside of the scope of this thesis.
Another outcome of this discussion is awareness that carbon nanotube
bundling within a network is lowered by the presence of surfactant
during deposition. Introducing steam when depositing with surfactant
lowers bundling even further, but also leads to residual surfactant
pooling and attaching to the substrate surface. These results may both
be explained by the presence of steam enabling surfactant to follow
carbon nanotubes to the substrate surface, which keeps them from
bundling during the attachment process. The unwanted persistence of
surfactant means that higher temperature vacuum annealing may be
required for robust biosensors \autocite{Kane2014}.

\end{figure}

Raman spectroscopy was also used to analyse and compare the deposited
carbon nanotube networks. Raman spectra were collected from a
solvent-deposited carbon nanotube film and a steam-assisted
surfactant-deposited film, both on silicon dioxide, in the manner
described in \textbf{?@sec-raman-characterisation}. These spectra were
then processed using the Python script mentioned in
Section~\ref{sec-raman-analysis}. For each location, spectra over two
wavenumber ranges were collected. A peak corresponding to the silicon
dioxide substrate, found in the range between 100 cm\(^{-1}\) and 650
cm\(^{-1}\), was used as a reference peak for the normalisation of
intensity across the wavenumber range between 1300 cm\(^{-1}\) and 1650
cm\(^{-1}\). These normalised spectra are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-pristine-raman}. In all spectra, a D-band comprising a
single D-peak is observed at \(\sim\) 1320 cm\(^{-1}\), and a G-band
comprising two G-peaks, G\(^-\) and G\(^+\), is observed between
\(\sim\) 1525 cm\(^{-1}\) and \(\sim\) 1650 cm\(^{-1}\). These features
are characteristic of networks of semiconducting carbon nanotubes
\autocite{Dresselhaus2005,King2014}.

Closer inspection of the D peak and G peaks can give us important
information about network composition. G\(^-\) is a minor peak found at
\(\sim\) 1570 cm\(^{-1}\), while G\(^+\) is a larger feature at \(\sim\)
1590 cm\(^{-1}\). The G\(^+\) feature describes the in-plane vibration
of carbon bonds along the length of the carbon nanotubes, while the
G\(^-\) feature describes the in-plane vibration of bonds about the
nanotube circumference \autocite{King2014,Swiniarski2021}. The splitting
between the wavenumber location of the G\(^-\) and G\(^+\) local maxima
is lower in Figure~\ref{fig-surfactant-deposited} than in
Figure~\ref{fig-solvent-deposited}, indicating more metallic nanotubes
are present in the surfactant-deposited network
\autocite{Swiniarski2021}. The D-peak gives an indication of the defects
present in the carbon nanotube atomic structure
\autocite{King2014,Swiniarski2021}. The size of the normalised D-peak
appears much lower in Figure~\ref{fig-solvent-deposited} than in
Figure~\ref{fig-surfactant-deposited}, indicating the solvent deposition
process introduces less defects to the carbon nanotubes than
surfactant-mediated deposition.

It is also possible to compare the relative magnitude of the D-peak and
G\(^+\)-peak intensity to quantify carbon nanotube structural disorder,
which disrupts in-plane lattice vibration
\autocite{Dresselhaus2005,King2014}. Figure~\ref{fig-dg-peak-comparison}
gives a summary of the ratios between the D-peak and G\(^+\)-peak across
all nine positions for the solvent-deposited and surfactant-deposited
film. It is immediately observed that I\(_{D}\)/I\(_{G}\) is
significantly larger for the steam-assisted, surfactant-deposited films
than for the solvent-deposited films. This is a further indication of
the presence of defects across the steam-deposited network. These
defects are likely introduced through the introduction of charge
impurites by surfactant aggregates present around the carbon nanotubes
\autocite{Christensen2022}. However, at the same time, the range of
values for the I\(_{D}\)/I\(_{G}\) ratio is lower for the
steam-deposited network. This spatially homogeneous vibrational
behaviour implies the steam-deposited network is more evenly distributed
than the solvent-deposited network, which matches the discussion in
Section~\ref{sec-pristine-morphology}.

Devices}\label{sec-pristine-electrical-characterisation}}

\hypertarget{sec-python-analysis}{%
\subsection{Python Analysis}\label{sec-python-analysis}}

Analysis of electrical measurements was performed using the three
modules described in Section~\ref{sec-field-effect-transistor-analysis}.
The first of the three modules is for processing sensing datasets. This
module cleans, analyses and filters sensing data and produces a variety
of plots. These plots include normalised plots (type of normalisation
can be set in the code config file), plots with fitted curves, plots
with the linear baseline drift removed, plots of signal with analyte
addition, ``despiked'' plots and ``filtered'' plots. The analysis used
to produce these plots is described further below. It is possible to add
annotations to any of these plots using the config file, and it is
possible to produce a plot with a combination of these modifications.
The module can also fit exponential and linear trendlines to regions of
the sensing data, and find the signal change per analyte addition; the
module then returns spreadsheets containing the results of these
analyses, including the standard deviation for all calculated
parameters.

The scipy.optimize.curve\_fit function is used in the first module to
fit linear and exponential curves to regions of interest of the sensing
data. For a linear fit \(mt + b\), initial parameters are simply set as
\(m=1\) and \(b=0\). For an exponential fit \(a\exp{(-t/\tau)} + c\),
rough approximations are used for the initial parameters: \(c\) is set
as the final current measurement of the region of interest, \(a\) is set
as the initial current measurement minus \(c\), and \(\tau\) is set as
the time where current has dropped to \(e^{-1}a + c\).

``Despiked'' plots have had spurious datapoints removed through the use
of an interquartile range rolling filter. The window size of the rolling
filter used was 40 datapoints, and datapoints in each window with a
z-score above \(\pm 3\) were removed from the plotted/processed data.
``Filtered'' plots had noise reduced using a moving median filter. The
moving median filter is more effective at removing noise than a simple
moving average, and has advantages over other filters (such as the
Savitzky-Golay filter) when removing noise from data with sharp edges,
as is the case for sensing data. Median filtering can also be used for
baseline drift compensation, though this approach was not used in this
thesis \autocite{Stone2011}. The moving median filter used had a window
of 40 datapoints.

Plots of signal with analyte addition were constructed from current data
after first removing baseline drift and applying a moving median filter.
A simple difference calculation between the mean of the filtered current
before an addition and the mean of the filtered current after the
addition was performed at each addition. These differences were then
normalised relative to the initial current. The signal with analyte
addition give reasonably consistent results regardless of whether
baseline drift was removed from the data, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-spaa-plot-comparison}. We can therefore be confident
that robust signal with analyte addition plots are robust even in the
presence of significant drift.

calculation was performed on filtered data with the baseline drift

\end{figure}

The second module creates combined and individual plots of transfer data
collected from eight channels on a single device. In combined plots,
channels which are non-working, due to being shorted or non-conducting,
are removed via setting a maximum and minimum possible on-current in the
config file. Various parameters from the transfer characteristics are
saved as a spreadsheet along with standard error. These parameters
include on current, off current, subthreshold slope and threshold
voltage for the carbon nanotube devices, and on current, off current and
major Dirac point voltage for graphene devices. The device type being
analysed can be set in the config file.

The third module allows for comparison of transfer measurements taken of
the same channel before and after some modification. It also calculates
the shift in either threshold voltage or major Dirac voltage of the
device.

Each carbon nanotube device fabricated was electrically characterised as

data was analysed using the Python code discussed in
Section~\ref{sec-field-effect-transistor-analysis}. Devices with a 100

comparison, each device here was encapsulated with AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518
encapsulation before measurements were taken. The channels which did not
exhibit reliable transistor characteristics are not shown. These
`non-working' channels were either shorted, due to metal remaining on
the channel after lift-off, or were very low current, due to a very
sparse carbon nanotube network. Devices shown here with a
solvent-deposited carbon nanotube network were fabricated prior to Jan
2022; devices with a surfactant-deposited network without steam present
were fabricated prior to Jun 2021; devices with a surfactant-deposited
network without steam were fabricated prior to Sep 2022.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Liquid-Gated CNTFETs}

The liquid-gated devices in Figure~\ref{fig-solvent-tx-lg},
Figure~\ref{fig-surf-tx-lg} and Figure~\ref{fig-steam-tx-lg} each
exhibited ambipolar characteristics, commonly observed in liquid-gated
carbon nanotube network FETs
\autocite{Kauffman2008,Heller2009,JongYu2009,Derenskyi2014,Murugathas2018,Albarghouthi2022}.
When devices were appropriately configured, leakage current (shown by
the dashed traces) did not exceed \(\sim 1 \times 10^{-7}\) V across the
forward and reverse sweep. The devices shown which used steam-deposited
carbon nanotube films showed the least hysteresis.
Section~\ref{sec-pristine-AFM} demonstrates that the mean diameter of
the bundles in these films is about 0.9 nm less than the mean bundles in
films deposited without steam present, and 5.5 nm less than those in
films deposited in solvent. Hysteresis is known to scale roughly
linearly with bundle diameter, due to trapped charge increasing as
bundle density of states is increased \autocite{Pop2009}.
Steam-deposited devices also showed significantly less
channel-to-channel variation in electrical characteristics more
generally. Channel 1 in Figure~\ref{fig-solvent-tx-lg} has a much higher
off-current than the other channels of the same device, which appears to
be due to a uncommonly high proportion of metallic carbon nanotubes
present in the network conduction pathways of this channel
\autocite{Rouhi2011,Zaumseil2015}.

A summary of key parameters of pristine liquid-gated devices is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-sweep-parameters}. The full dataset consists of three
sets of 21 liquid-gated transfer characteristics of working channels,
with each set corresponding to the use of a particular method of carbon
nanotube network deposition in the device fabrication. Measurements from
at least three devices are included in each set. Each entry in the
summary corresponds to the average of the specific parameter in the
forward and reverse sweep direction. When steam was used for surfactant
deposition of films, the resulting devices showed highly consistent
channel-to-channel electrical properties. Since the carbon nanotube
films on these devices are relatively dense, as seen in
Figure~\ref{fig-steaming-network}, the network should be well above the
percolation threshold. As many carbon nanotube pathways connect across
the channel in parallel, small variations in the network morphology have
less of an impact on the overall channel behaviour
\autocite{Murugathas2018}. Figure~\ref{fig-cnt-histogram} and
Table~\ref{tbl-histogram-parameters} indicate that the range of bundle
sizes is relatively low in the steam-deposited films used in these
devices, meaning the electrical behaviour of dominant conduction
pathways is more spatially consistent. The repeatable subthreshold
regime behaviour between channels seen for steam-deposited devices is a
desirable attribute for reliable real-time multiplexed biosensing
\autocite{Kauffman2008,Heller2009,Gao2010}.

Channels from surfactant-deposited film devices usually showed a larger
on-off ratio and subthreshold slope than those from solvent-deposited
devices. Decreasing the ratio of gate-sensitive semiconducting carbon
nanotubes to metallic nanotubes tends to decrease the on-off ratio
\autocite{LeMieux2008,Rouhi2011,Zaumseil2015,Murugathas2018}.
Section~\ref{sec-pristine-raman} seems to indicate there are more
metallic nanotubes present in the surfactant-deposited films than in the
solvent-deposited films. However, percolating conduction pathways
dominate device behaviour and nanotube pathways across the channel with
a lower degree of bundling are less likely to contain metallic tubes
\autocite{Murugathas2018}. Therefore, the larger on-off ratio for
surfactant-deposited film devices is likely a result of their reduced
nanotube bundle size and reduced bundle size variation relative to other
films, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec-pristine-morphology}. The larger
subthreshold slope is likely due to increased mobility from a denser
nanotube network in surfactant-deposited films \autocite{Rouhi2011}, as
seen in Figure~\ref{fig-steaming-network}. A larger on-off ratio and
subthreshold slope results in a larger change in conductance in response
to changes in the transfer characteristic curve. Therefore, the larger
on-off ratio and subthreshold slope of steam-deposited devices is
desirable for improved sensor performance
\autocite{Kauffman2008,Heller2009,Gao2010}.

All channels characterised had a positive threshold voltage
(\(V_{th}\)). The threshold voltage was largest and most consistent for
steam-assisted surfactant-deposited films. The relatively high values of
\(V_{th}\) which correspond to channel measurements from steam-assisted
surfactant-deposited devices indicates increased \(p\)-doping of the
network relative to networks deposited via alternative processes
\autocite{Kang2005,Heller2008,Murugathas2018}. As seen from
Figure~\ref{fig-steamed-surfactant}-f and
Figure~\ref{fig-dg-peak-comparison}, the steam deposition process leads
to the presence of significant, persistent surfactant aggregates. It has
been previously established that residual surfactant can \(p\)-dope
carbon nanotubes, alongside enhancing \(p\)-doping from adsorped oxygen
and water \autocite{Kane2014,Nonoguchi2018,Christensen2022}. The
presence of residual surfactant may also explain the lowered
subthreshold slope, and therefore mobility, of the steam-deposited
devices relative to devices with films deposited in surfactant without
steam. The analysis by Kane \emph{et al.} shows that the thermal
annealling at 150\(^\circ\)C used in this work to remove residual
surfactant is likely inadequate for this purpose. Oxidation of devices
and vacuum annealling at high temperatures (\textgreater{}
600\^{}\circ\$C) may be required for effective desorption o f the
persistent surfactant \autocite{Kane2014,Barnett2018}. Devices using
films made using the alternative two methods have the advantage of not
requiring careful treatment to remove surfactant.

\subsubsection*{Back-Gated CNTFETs}\label{back-gated-cntfets}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Back-Gated CNTFETs}

When characterising devices using the vapour delivery system chip
carrier, the setup arrangement meant all measurements were taken using a
backgate. Figure~\ref{fig-solvent-tx-bg}, Figure~\ref{fig-surf-tx-bg}
and Figure~\ref{fig-steam-tx-bg} show that backgated devices exhibit
\emph{p}-type transistor behaviour. Gate current leakage was negligible,
as shown by the dashed line staying close to zero across the sweep.
Significant hysteresis was observed. The hysteresis can be explained by
the presence of defects or charge traps within and on the surface of the
silicon dioxide and at interfaces between the silicon dioxide and carbon
nanotubes \autocite{Lee2007,Lee2012,Ha2014}. The hysteresis observed was
much greater than for the corresponding liquid-gated sweeps on the
right. The devices fabricated with a solvent-based deposition were
switched off at a lower voltage than the devices which used surfactant
during deposition.

Transfer measurements were taken to determine whether backgated
measurements could be taken of an unencapsulated device in the vapour
sensor chamber with 1XPBS covering the channels.
Figure~\ref{fig-buffer-effect-on-backgate} shows the behaviour of an
unencapsulated backgated device with a 300 nm SiO\(_2\) layer before and
after being covered by 50 \(\mu\)L of 1XPBS (phosphate buffered saline).
The on-off ratio and hysteresis of the channels increase significantly.
The presence of water increases hysteresis through introducing charge
traps at the silicon dioxide surface around the carbon nanotubes and at
the surface of the nanotubes themselves
\autocite{Kim2003,Lee2007,Franklin2012,Ha2014}. There is also a
significant increase in current leakage to the backgate for larger
applied voltages, despite the electrolyte having no visible physical
contact with the silicon backgate or copper plane. This leakage current
may simply be due to an increase in relative humidity around the device
due to the presence of water \autocite{Conseil2014}. As any variation in
threshold voltage due to hysteresis and significant leakage current are
undesirable for sensing procedures, this configuration was not used for
vapour sensing purposes.

Graphene field-effect transistor devices were electrically characterised
in the manner described in \textbf{?@sec-electrical-characterisation}
and analysed using the Python code discussed in
Section~\ref{sec-field-effect-transistor-analysis}.

Figure~\ref{fig-pristine-graphene} shows the liquid-gated transfer
characteristics of two graphene devices. These devices were fabricated
prior to Jun 2021. Both devices exhibit the ambipolar characteristics
typical of liquid-gated graphene devices
\autocite{Heller2009a,Heller2010,Xia2010,Kireev2017}. As with the carbon
nanotube network devices, leakage current remained below \(\sim\) 1
\(\times\) \(10^{-7}\) V across both the forward and reverse sweep.
Hysteresis between the forward and reverse sweep is caused by trapping
of charge within and on the surface of the SiO\(_{2}\) dielectric
\autocite{Bartolomeo2011}. The major Dirac point for these devices is
slightly to the right of V\(_{\textrm{Dirac}} \approxeq\) 0 V, which
indicates \(p\)-doping of the channel. This slight \(p\)-doping is
likely a result of a adsorption of oxygen and water from the air and
residue resist from photolithography
\autocite{Cheng2011,Shin2012,Kireev2017}.

Some devices exhibited a double-minima feature, indicating the presence
of two Dirac points. This effect arises due to doping of graphene by the
metal contacts. In shorter length channels, metal doping affects the
entire channel length, leading to a consistent Fermi level and a single
Dirac point. However, for longer channel lengths like ours, the doping
effect from metal contact no longer reaches the entire channel, leading
to a difference in Fermi level between the graphene in the channel and
graphene under the metal contact. The difference in Fermi levels results
in the presence of a second Dirac point
\autocite{Bartolomeo2011,Feng2014,Peng2018}. The global minimum of the
transfer characteristic can be referred to as the `major' Dirac point.

Figure~\ref{fig-pristine-graphene} also shows the effect of 1XPBS on the
graphene channels. The channels were measured on exposure to 1XPBS,
after exposure to 1XPBS for one hour, and after the device surface was
rinsed and 1XPBS was replaced in the well one time, two times and three
times successively. A slight negative shift of the major Dirac point was
observed. This effect is possibly a result of gate bias stress, where
successive transfer sweeps introduce charge traps to the graphene layer
and alters the current level at a given gate voltage
\autocite{Bargaoui2018,Noyce2019}. Alternatively, Kireev \emph{et al.}
found that a series of liquid-gated sweeps also reduced the size of the
second Dirac point, and suggested that it indicated the gate current was
removing atmospheric contaminants from the graphene surface via current
annealing \autocite{Kireev2017}. This could be explained as the removal
of contaminants causing improved contact between the metal and graphene
surface, and thus increasing metal doping and consistency of the Fermi
level across the channel. If the contaminants removed are \(p\)-dopants,
then this effect could also explain the negative shift of the major
Dirac point.

To verify the sensitivity of the fabricated field-effect transistors and
therefore verify their suitability for sensing, control measurements
replicating a typical sensing experiment were taken before
functionalising the device channels. This involved first ensuring the
device showed no response to 1XPBS, a sequence referred to here as the
`PBS control series'. The PDMS well contained 80 \(\mu\)L 1X PBS at 0 s.
The PBS control series ran over the first 1800 s, with 20\(\mu\)L
phosphate buffer saline (1XPBS) additions at 100 s, 200 s and 300 s, and
20\(\mu\)L subtractions at 400 s, 500 s and 600 s. The device was left
untouched over the next 1200 s to allow the current level to settle. The
gate voltage was held at \(V_g\) = 0 V.

Figure~\ref{fig-transfer-sweeps} shows the transfer sweeps of the six
working channels of a steam-assisted surfactant-deposited carbon
nanotube field-effect transistor encapsulated with AZ\(^\circledR\)
1518, fabricated in Mar 2023 and measured using the PXIe. The central
`negative current' feature in the transfer characteristics of channels 1
and 7 is due to unphysical measurements which come from equipment error
and can be treated as zero current passing through the channel. The
threshold voltages of the channels are shown in
Table~\ref{tbl-threshold-voltages}. Table~\ref{tbl-threshold-voltages}
also shows the difference between the threshold voltage of each channel
and the mean threshold voltage of the device. The mean threshold voltage
was \(V_{th}\) = \(150 \pm 20\) mV. As discussed previously, the
electrical characteristics are highly consistent between the channels
due to the film deposition method used.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-linear-fit} shows the PBS control series corresponding
to each device channel alongside gate current. In both series, there is
no clear stepwise response to any addition or subtraction of 1XPBS. Gate
leakage current remains negligible across the entire control series,
with no change in response to 1XPBS additions. The current has a period
of faster decay followed by slower baseline drift, similar to
observations by Lin \emph{et al.} and more recently Noyce \emph{et al.}
for parallel arrangements of single carbon nanotubes in air or vacuum
\autocite{Lin2006,Noyce2019}. This effect results from changes in the
occupancy of charge traps in and around the substrate and carbon
nanotubes. The magnitude of baseline drift is lower for our devices than
for those characterised by Noyce \emph{et al.}, which may be a result of
numerous device and setup differences which affect the presence of
charge traps. These differences include liquid-gating instead of
back-gated, the use of a network of carbon nanotubes instead of single
nanotubes, a different channel length, the use of a 300 nm instead of 90
nm SiO\(_2\) layer, and the use of an asymmetric, liquid-gated transfer
sweep over a shorter voltage range to characterise devices before each
control series was measured \autocite{Noyce2019}.

As a first approximation to the longer time constant exponentials
discussed by Noyce \emph{et al.} \autocite{Noyce2019}, linear fits were
performed on each PBS control series from \(1200-1800\) s. These linear
fits are shown by the dashed yellow lines in
Figure~\ref{fig-linear-fit}. The parameters from each fit in
Figure~\ref{fig-linear-fit} are shown in Table~\ref{tbl-linear-fits},
where \(I = c_1t + c_2\). The fits for channels 1, 5 and 7 are all in
parallel within error. The gradient value for each fit in
Figure~\ref{fig-linear-fit} is reasonably consistent between all
channels, all falling within a 2.6 pA/s range. When the long-term linear
fits were subtracted from the raw data, the remaining dataset followed a
exponential decay trend for both control series.
Figure~\ref{fig-exp-fit} shows exponential fits to the remaining curve
from \(0-1200\) s, which was successful for all channels except channel
5. The parameters from each fit are shown in Table~\ref{tbl-exp-fits},
where \(I = A\exp(-t/\tau)\). The exponential fits had characteristic
time constants \(\tau\) ranging between \(300 - 800\) s, indicating that
1800 s is a sufficient length of time for this short-term baseline drift
to completely decay to zero. The exponential term for channel 1 is close
to linear, indicating the channel has low net trapped charge. It is
unclear why the behaviour of this channel is signficantly different from
the others.

From this analysis it appears that the baseline drift for the
liquid-gated carbon nanotube devices can be accurately approximated as a
combination of a exponential and linear term. The lack of response to
1XPBS at any of the six PBS addition and removal times gives us
confidence that this is a stable baseline which can be used for reliable
chemical sensing. Furthermore, after \(\sim 800\) s the baseline drift
can be reasonably approximated as linear, with a small gradient of less
than -10 pA/s. The slow change of current means that it becomes easier
to distinguish responses due to analyte addition. It can therefore be
concluded that the 1800 s length of the PBS control series is
appropriate for minimising baseline drift for more reliable sensing.

\subsection{Sensing Series}\label{sec-salt-conc-series}}

A salt concentration sensing series were performed from 1800 s onwards,
directly after the PBS control series. The responses to successive
dilutions of the liquid-gate electrolyte were recorded to confirm the
fabricated devices were sensitive to small environmental changes in
their pristine state, to check for spurious signals, and to ensure gate
current leakage or other confounding factors were not contributing to
sensing responses. The PDMS well contained 80 \(\mu\)L 1X PBS at 1800 s.
During the series, successive additions of deionised water were made to
reduce the concentration of PBS in the well. An initial 1X PBS addition
was performed at 2100s, to confirm no changes occurred during the PBS
control series that would interfere with sensing. All additions to the
well in the sensing series and resulting changes to the PBS
concentration in the well are shown in Table~\ref{tbl-salt-conc-series}.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-salt-conc-no-norm} shows a multiplexed salt
concentration sensing series from the channels of a single
AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518 encapsulated device, measured with the NI-PXIe.
The gate voltage used was 0 V, which meant current measurements were
well above the magnitude of the subthreshold device current. Gate
current measurements did not exceed 1 nA for the SU8 encapsulated
devices, and did not exceed 10 nA for the AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518 devices.
At each of the deionised water addition times, the current traces for at
least two out of six channels showed a sharp, transient increase in
current followed by a return to an increased baseline. It is well
established that changing the salt concentration of the liquid gate has
an electrostatic gating effect on the carbon nanotubes or graphene, and
changes the transfer characteristics of the channel. This shift in
transfer characteristic leads to a real-time signal response to each
addition \autocite{Heller2009,Heller2010,Kireev2017}.

Using the data in Table~\ref{tbl-linear-fits}, the linear term
approximating baseline drift (\(mt\)) for each channel can be subtracted
from the data in Figure~\ref{fig-salt-conc-no-norm} to account for the
downward drift. The mean current level just before 1800 s then becomes
roughly constant. Next, each channel is normalised relative to their
initial mean current level \(I_{0}\). Artifacts resulting from PXIe-2737
module lag, single datapoints which fall well below the current level of
the immediately preceding and succeeding datapoints, are also removed.
This `despike' process uses an interquartile range filter, which is
described in Section~\ref{sec-field-effect-transistor-analysis}. The
resulting dataset is shown in Figure~\ref{fig-salt-conc-detrend}. This
figure shows that the signal-to-noise ratio remains roughly similar
across all channels of the device. However, the behaviour of the initial
transient increase with each addition is highly variable across channels
and between additions for a single channel.

As measurement of the highly variable initial transient is not useful
for robust sensing purposes, a moving median filter was applied, with
the implementation of this filter discussed in
Section~\ref{sec-field-effect-transistor-analysis}. The filtered data is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig-salt-conc-detrend-filter}. Noise and initial
transients are removed completely, while the clearly defined step to a
new current baseline is retained. Using the realtime data in
Figure~\ref{fig-salt-conc-detrend-filter}, a plot of signal against
addition can be created using the method described in
Section~\ref{sec-field-effect-transistor-analysis}, shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-salt-conc-signal}. This presentation of the data allows
us to see the increase at each step relative to \(I_{0}\).

Intriguingly, even though the largest change in PBS concentration
occurred at the first deionised water addition (see
Table~\ref{tbl-salt-conc-series}), there was very little signal change
across all channels, while a relatively large change occurred at the
second addition. The logarithm of final salt concentration has
previously been shown to be proportional to conductance change in the
linear on-regime \autocite{Heller2010}.
Figure~\ref{fig-salt-conc-box-plot} shows the signal change presented in
terms of this logarithmic relationship. The median values of the first
two additions do not line up well with the overall logarithmic trend;
insufficient mixing in the tightly enclosed PDMS well environment for
the first few additions may be responsible for this result. Subsequent
additions may improve mixing in the well, leading to the change in
concentration at the surface of the channel being more representative of
the overall concentration in the well.

Figure~\ref{fig-salt-conc-detrend} and
Figure~\ref{fig-salt-conc-detrend-filter} is normalised to \(I_{0}\),
but an alternative normalisation can more effectively filter out
remaining drift present. This normalisation presents data relative to
both \(I_{0}\) and the final current reading \(I_{f}\) using the formula
\((I - I_{0})/(I_{f} - I_{0})\). Using this normalisation, the data in
Figure~\ref{fig-salt-conc-detrend} and
Figure~\ref{fig-salt-conc-detrend-filter} can be displayed instead as
(a) and (b) respectively. (c) shows a magnified version of the step at
addition 2 in (a).}

\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig-salt-conc-detrend} and
Figure~\ref{fig-salt-conc-detrend-filter}, from around the second
deionised water addition onwards, the drift behaviours of individual
channels begin to significantly diverge. This deviation from the
baseline drift subtracted from the raw data occurs either because the
linear fit is only a first-order approximation which weakens with time,
or because the additions themselves affect the drift behaviour.
Displaying the data as discrete signal changes, as in
Figure~\ref{fig-salt-conc-signal}, is one way of excluding these
deviations (see Section~\ref{sec-field-effect-transistor-analysis}). An
alternative way of presenting the signal changes, by normalising
relative to both \(I_{0}\) and the final current reading with the
formula \((I - I_{0})/(I_{f} - I_{0})\), is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-salt-conc-sensing-2}. This approach is useful for
filtering out remaining unaccounted-for drift behaviour in order to
compare the short-term transient responses to additions across the
device channels. Furthermore, it lets us better understand how the
short-term transient responses affect the longer-term step responses
discussed earlier.

Figure~\ref{fig-salt-conc-detrend-2} and
Figure~\ref{fig-salt-conc-detrend-filter-single-step} show that the
transient responses to DI water additions vary significantly across the
surface of the device. For example,
Figure~\ref{fig-salt-conc-detrend-filter-single-step} shows that in
response to the second DI water addition, channel 7 gives a large
initial transient response about twice the size of the step increase
between 2600 and 2800 s. Meanwhile, channels 1 and 2 show no transient
response above the step increase.
Figure~\ref{fig-salt-conc-detrend-filter-single-step} indicates
transient size is based on location across the device, with neighbouring
channels showing the most similar behaviour. This spatially-dependent
behaviour may indicate transient responses are determined by the
location of the channel relative to either the location of water
additions or the slightly-variable location of the liquid gate. Larger
and longer-lasting transient responses are not entirely removed by the
moving median filter, as shown by comparing
Figure~\ref{fig-salt-conc-detrend-2} to
Figure~\ref{fig-salt-conc-detrend-filter}, and so careful placement of
additions is important when sensing to minimise this effect. However,
even the longest-lasting transients appear to decay to zero within about
200 s, demonstrating that a 200 s spacing between additions at minimum
is necessary for reliable real-time liquid-gated sensing using this
setup.

To understand the effect of gate voltages on signal-to-noise ratio, two
PBS control and salt concentration sensing series were performed with
the same channel at different gate voltages. The transfer
characteristics of this channel are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-transfer-sweep-2}, with coloured dashed lines marking
the voltages used for gating the transistor during each sesning series.
Figure~\ref{fig-salt-conc-SNR} shows the initial PBS and DI water
additions made after 1800 s. Previous work on the signal-to-noise ratio
for liquid-gated, encapsulated carbon nanotube devices suggests that
gating devices close to \(V_{gap}\) should give the largest
signal-to-noise ratio for salt concentration additions
\autocite{Heller2009}. However, this was not what was observed for our
carbon nanotube field-effect transitor, as
Figure~\ref{fig-salt-conc-SNR} shows improved signal-to-noise ratio,
i.e.~the signal step can be more clearly distinguished, when gated at a
voltage further removed from \(V_{gap}\). This discrepancy could be a
result of the use of a network of carbon nanotubes rather than a single
nanotube; gating may have less of an impact on noise when a network
morphology is used. Alternatively, it could be a result of a lack of
mixing in our static well setup leading to inconsistent signal sizes
with concentration change. Heller \emph{et al.} used a flow cell during
their signal-to-ratio work \autocite{Heller2009}. By using a flow cell
with our devices, it would be possible to confirm whether this is the
case, and this might also help us reduce the size of unwanted transient
responses resulting from drop-wise additions.

\subsection{Baseline Drift}\label{sec-vapour-drift}}

When sensing vapour in the vapour delivery system, devices have no
liquid gate and are instead backgated when taking measurements.
Therefore, the baseline drift of devices characterised in this manner
should be considered separately to those characterised in an
liquid-gated environment. Device baseline drift of a backgated device in
the vapour sensing chamber is therefore examined here in more detail.

The magnitude of baseline drift is lower for our devices than for those
characterised by Noyce \emph{et al.}, which may be a result of numerous
device and setup differences which affect the presence of charge traps.
These differences include liquid-gating instead of back-gated, the use
of a network of carbon nanotubes instead of single nanotubes, a
different channel length, the use of a 300 nm instead of 90 nm SiO\(_2\)
layer, and the use of an asymmetric, liquid-gated transfer sweep over a
shorter voltage range to characterise devices before each control series
was measured \autocite{Noyce2019}.

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

To ensure fabricated transistors were suitable for biosensing purposes,
the morphology and electrical properties of the pristine carbon nanotube
and graphene transistors were investigated.

The morphology of the carbon nanotube networks were found to have a
significant impact on the electrical characteristics of the devices,
which was determined through comparison of the skew-normal height
profile of the carbon nanotube network and the key electrical parameters
of a range of carbon nanotube devices. When networks were highly bundled
(\(>90\) \%), there was a large range of carbon nanotube bundle
diameters present in the network. This large variation in the size of
conducting pathways resulted in a wide range of on-off ratios and
threshold voltages for the liquid-gated devices created using these
carbon nanotube films. In contrast, devices using films fabricated with
a relatively low percentage of bundling (\(<75\) \%) showed highly
consistent on-off ratios and threshold voltages, along with low
hysteresis, due to the relatively consistent bundle diameters and high
density of these networks. These low-bundling networks were found to
have a mean bundle distribution height of \(3.3 \pm 1.0\) nm. When
performing multiplexed sensing, consistent channel behaviour is highly
desirable since comparing sensing behaviour between channels is more
straightforward.

However, atomic force microscope imaging and Raman spectroscopy also
indicated that less bundled networks had the most surface contamination
present. Aggregated surfactant present on the surface had a height of
more than 4 nm, and introduced significant defects to the carbon
nanotube network. The introduction of \(p\)-dopants to the carbon
nanotubes by surfactant appears to have significantly increased the
threshold voltage of steam-assisted surfactant-deposited network devices
relative to steam-free surfactant-deposited network devices. Since the
presence of surfactant could negatively impact biosensing, techniques to
remove contaminants should be explored in more detail. Oxidation and
thermal annealing of carbon nanotube films at high temperatures could be
used to resolve this issue, and this is discussed further in
\textbf{?@sec-future-work}. The presence of electrolyte on the surface
of a backgated transistor for use in vapour sensing was also found to
significantly adversely affect its electrical characteristics.

Constant voltage real-time measurements of the carbon nanotube
field-effect transistor devices had a characteristic drift that could be
modelled using a exponential and linear term. The linear term of
baseline drift had a reasonably consistent gradient between device
channels, with a mean value of \(-6.1 \pm 1.2\), indicating that similar
drift behaviour should be reproducible between devices fabricated in the
same manner. The time constant of the exponential term ranged from
\(\tau = 330 \pm 20\) s to \(\tau = 800 \pm 750\) for the device
characterised. These results indicate that the PBS control series is
asuitable time length for minimising the effects of baseline drift on
sensing, since the range of time constants are all well below the total
timescale of the control series.

Salt concentration or PBS dilution sensing series indicated that the
carbon nanotube transistor devices were highly sensitive to
environmental changes and therefore suitable for sensing work.
Successive additions of deionised water to the 1XPBS present in the well
gave signal responses of up to 2.5 \% above the control response. The
signal response was found to be proportional to the logarithm of
concentration, giving a fit to the median response sizes with an
\(R^2 = 0.86\). Deviations from this trend can possibly be explained by
the enclosed sensing environment preventing sufficient mixing of
electrolyte concentrations within the PDMS well, which could possibly be
addressed by using a flow cell for sensing work. It was also seen that
the signal size relative to baseline drift was highly consistent between
channels. This is a promising result when it comes to ensuring
consistent multiplexing, but it cannot be guaranteed that this behaviour
carries over to sensing with biofunctionalised devices.

Graphene field-effect transistor devices were often found to possess a
double-minima feature, which appears to be the result of a lack of
doping from the metal contacts in the center of the device channels.
These double Dirac points are unlikely to have an significant effect on
the sensing behaviour of graphene devices. The graphene device
characteristics were found to be consistent after 1 hour exposure to 1X
PBS with minimal drift, with an on-off ratio of 5 and major Dirac point
voltage of 0.3 V. There was some indications from the transfer
characteristics that \(p\)-dopants were present on the graphene surface.
Salt concentration sensing with graphene FETs is not shown in this
thesis, but it is important to perform this experiment and use similar
analysis techniques if there are any concerns about the sensitivity of a
fabricated batch of graphene devices.

either taken from the Keysight 4156C Semiconductor Parameter Analyser,
National Instruments NI-PXIe or Keysight B1500A Semiconductor Device

code is able to analyse data in .csv format taken from all three
measurement setups. The main Python file in the code base consists of
three related but independent modules: the first analyses and plots
sensing data from the FET devices, the second analyses and plots
transfer characteristics from channels across a device, and the third
compares individual channel characteristics before and after a
