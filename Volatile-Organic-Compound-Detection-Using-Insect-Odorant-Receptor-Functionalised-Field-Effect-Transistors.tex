Carbon nanotube network and graphene field-effect transistors (CNTFETs
and GFETs) are both examples of a class of transistors called thin-film
transistors (TFTs). These transistors are closely related to the
commonly-used metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor
(MOSFET). However, unlike in MOSFETs, in TFTs the transistor substrate
is not used as the channel; instead, current passes through the
semiconducting film, which is contacted via conductive source and drain
electrodes. This semiconducting film may be a network of carbon
nanotubes or layers of graphene \autocite{Sun2013}.

FETs are unipolar transistors: these transistors only use one type of
charge carrier in the conducting channel. For \(n\)-type conducting
channels, these charge carriers are negative electrons, while \(p\)-type
conducting channels use holes, positive charge carriers. The FET
consists of a source, a drain, and a gate. The behaviour of carriers in
the channel between the source and the drain is controlled capacitively
by applied electric fields: hence the term `field effect'. A FET
contains a potential barrier acting against charge carriers at the
junctions between the channel and the contacts, known as `Schottky
barriers'. These barriers arise because of the Fermi energy difference
between the metal contacts and the semiconducting channel, and are
characterised by the size of the barrier potential \(Ï†_B\)
\autocite{Iijima1991}. Increased barrier size leads to increased
resistance between the component materials of the FET
\autocite{Zheng2016}.

\hypertarget{electrical-characterisation}{%
\subsection{Electrical
Characterisation}\label{electrical-characterisation}}

CNTFETs are traditionally \emph{p}-type transistors with positive charge
carriers \autocite{Martel1998,Kong2000}, while GFETs are ambipolar
\autocite{Ohno2010a}. Applying an gate voltage V\(_g\) to the gate of a
CNTFET or GFET increases, or decreases, the number of available charge
carriers, by bringing the relevant charge-carrying band closer to, or
further away from, the Fermi level of the channel \autocite{Sze2006}. An
example of both back-gated and liquid-gated transfer characteristics
from thin-film transistors are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-gating-transfer}.

\(V_{ds}\) is the voltage between the source and drain electrodes at
either end of the semiconducting channel, and is known as the `drain
bias'. \(V_g\) is the potential beneath the gate, and is known as the
`gate bias'. The gate is insulated from the semiconducting channel by an
oxide layer. \(I_d\) is the current that flows through the FET from the
source to the drain. The current-voltage plot of \(I_d\) against \(V_g\)
is called the `transfer characteristic curve' of the FET, while the I-V
curve of \(I_d\) against \(V_{ds}\) is called the `source-drain
characteristic curve' of the FET.

\(V_g\) is used to turn the FET on or off. A FET is known as
`normally-off' if at zero gate bias the channel conductance is very low,
and gate voltage must be applied to make the channel conductive.
Conversely, a FET is `normally-on' when the channel is conductive with
zero gate bias and must have a gate voltage applied to be turned off.
For \(p\)-type channel FETs, negative Vg brings the valence band closer
to the Fermi level, meaning more positive charge carriers are available.
Therefore these devices are made more conductive with a more negative
gate bias; an increase in \(V_g\) reduces \(I_d\). The opposite is true
for \(n\)-type channel devices, where a more positive \(V_g\) brings the
conduction band closer to the Fermi level, meaning more negative charge
carriers are available, making the device more conductive. The increased
availability of majority carriers in both cases is known as
`accumulation'. Figure~\ref{fig-accumulation} illustrates accumulation
in each situation.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth,height=\textheight]{figures/ch2/accumulation.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-accumulation}Energy band diagrams for a FET device
under accumulation conditions, where the left side of each diagram is
the gate region, while the right side is the channel region
\autocite{Sze2006}.}

\end{figure}

An important attribute of the transfer characteristic curve for all
thin-film FETs is the on-off current ratio. On-off current ratio is the
ratio of the current through a device when gated fully ``off'' with a
positive voltage, to the current through the device when gated fully
``on'' with a negative voltage \autocite{Zheng2017}. The off current in
an ambipolar FET can be defined as the minimum current during the
transfer sweep, where the majority carrier transitions from being holes
to electrons or vice versa. For example, the on current of the channel
shown in Figure~\ref{fig-gating-transfer} (b) is 741.5 nA, the off
current is 0.2 nA, and therefore the on-off ratio is \(\sim\) 3000. In
contrast, even when 10 V is applied, the backgated device shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-gating-transfer} (a) is never gated fully off.
Application of higher voltages to the gate result in significant leakage
currents through the gate, and can even result in irreversible breakdown
of the oxide layer \autocite{Sze2006}. Being able to traverse both on
and off regimes over a limited voltage interval is one of the many
advantages of the liquid-gated configuration.

In the linear \(I_d\)-\(V_{ds}\) regime, transconductance is given by
\(dI_{d}/dV_g\), which gives a measure of the mobility of the charge
carriers in the device channel \autocite{Martel1998,Sze2006,Zheng2017}.

Traditionally, for sensor applications \(V_g\) is chosen to maximise
transconductance, as this is considered to be the operating point where
the channel is most sensitive to changes in the local environment
\autocite{Ohno2010a,Choi2012}. However, for carbon nanotube FETs it has
been suggested that operating in the subthreshold regime gives improved
signal-to-noise ratio \autocite{Heller2009}. A discussion about the
subthreshold regime of CNTFETs is found in
Section~\ref{sec-electrical-characterisation-CNT}.

Channel carriers in a FET can be accelerated by a sufficiently high
gate-channel field into surmounting the insulating barrier between the
gate and channel. This is known as `breakdown'. The breakdown voltage
\(V_b\) gives an upper limit to the bias able to be applied across the
device without the device being destroyed. Percolation theory can be
used to explain breakdown. As energetic carriers pass through the oxide,
defects are created randomly. When these random defects are dense enough
to form a chain from the gate to the semiconductor, a short is created
and breakdown occurs. With decreased oxide thickness the the required
voltage for breakdown also decreases, due to increased carrier
tunnelling.

\hypertarget{current-sampling}{%
\subsection{Current Sampling}\label{current-sampling}}

It is important to account for the changes in current that occur during
a sensing run that are unrelated to sensing, and try to minimise these
changes as much as possible. These changes are due to a variety of
causes and can be categorised as various types of noise and baseline
drift. (1/f noise paper, heller paper)

As graphene FETs are ambipolar, they do not possess a characteristic
`off' regime. In normal operation of a GFET, the lowest voltage
obtainable by gating is known as the Dirac voltage
\autocite{Murugathas2020}.

\subsection{Composition and Chirality}\label{composition-and-chirality}}

A single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) consists of a graphene sheet, a
flat carbon lattice with hexagonal cells, rolled up into a cylinder.
Since their discovery in 1991, a wide range of device applications for
carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been proposed, based on CNTs being highly
sensitive to their environment
\autocite{Iijima1991,Battie2010,Boyd2014,Chen2019}. This high
sensitivity is due to the high surface-to-volume ratio of the CNTs,
which maximises the exposure of this electrically sensitive structure to
its surroundings \autocite{Battie2010}. SWCNT-based devices consume
little power, operate quickly and are flexible \autocite{Chen2019}.
Nanotubes in a network can have semiconducting characteristics (s-CNTs)
or metallic characteristics (m-CNTs), depending on their chirality
\autocite{Martel1998,Kong2000}. A single CNT will therefore have
different properties than a network of CNTs, where the individual
electrical properties of the CNT tubes are averaged out across the
network \autocite{Battie2010}.

\hypertarget{threshold-voltage}{%
\subsubsection*{Threshold Voltage}\label{threshold-voltage}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Threshold Voltage}

The threshold voltage is the voltage required to fully deplete the
device channel of charge carriers \autocite{Martel1998}. It can be
estimated by extrapolating the linear part of the transfer
characteristics of a device to the \(V_g\) axis.

The FET turns on at the `threshold voltage', \(V_g\) = \(V_t\). For the
\(p\)-type FET, when \(V_g\) \textgreater{} \(V_t\), \(I_d\) increases
linearly.

After decreasing past \(V_t\), \(I_d\) stays constant at its `on' value
\(I_{ON}\). The ratio of \(I_{ON}\) to the \(I_{OFF}\) current is known
as the FET device's `on-off ratio', \(I_{ON}/I_{OFF}\). The threshold
voltage can be calculated by using an FET's transfer characteristics.
From extrapolating the trendline of the linear region to the \(V_g\)
axis, the intercept \(V_{gInt}\) is approximately equivalent to \(V_t\)
\autocite{Sze2006}.

Threshold Voltage: minimum gate-to-source voltage that is needed to
create a conducting path between the electrodes

Quantative measurement of leftward shift in transfer curve Use minima of
curve in reverse sweep direction (more consistent than reading in
forward sweep direction) I compared the transfer characteristics after
then rinse steps to the pristine characteristics Transfer shifts where
current drops to zero are excluded (indicates delamination/damage to
channel)

Second quantative measurement of leftward shift in transfer curve Use
curve in reverse sweep direction (more consistent than reading in
forward sweep direction) Separate readings for left and right hand sides
of transfer curve (left side = electrons dominant carrier, right side =
holes dominant carrier) Transfer shifts where current drops to zero are
excluded (indicates delamination/damage to channel) This gives us a
quantitative idea of whether the transfer shifts in slides 5/6 are
stable (remain the same/similar after rinse steps)

The purpose of this code is to analyse atomic force microscope (AFM)
images of carbon nanotube networks in .xyz format taken using an atomic
force microscope and processed in Gwyddion (see
\textbf{?@sec-afm-characterisation}). It was originally designed by
Erica Happe in Matlab, and adapted by Marissa Dierkes and myself for use
in Python. The code imports the .xyz data and sorts it into bins 0.15 nm
in size for processing. To perform skew-normal distribution fits, both
\emph{scipy.optimize.curve\_fit} and \emph{scipy.stats.skewnorm} modules
are used in this code.

\section{Raman Spectroscopy Analysis}\label{sec-raman-analysis}}

The purpose of this code is to analyse a series of Raman spectra taken
at different points on a single film (see
\textbf{?@sec-raman-characterisation}). Data is imported in a series of
tab-delimited text files, with the low wavenumber spectrum (100
cm\(^{-1} - 650\) cm\(^{-1}\)) and high wavenumber spectrum (1300
cm\(^{-1} - 1650\) cm\(^{-1}\)) imported in separate datafiles for each
scan location.

\section{Field-Effect Transistor
Analysis}\label{sec-field-effect-transistor-analysis}}

The purpose of this code is to analyse electrical measurements taken of
field-effect transistor (FET) devices. Electrical measurements were
either taken from the Keysight 4156C Semiconductor Parameter Analyser,
National Instruments NI-PXIe or Keysight B1500A Semiconductor Device
Analyser as discussed in \textbf{?@sec-electrical-characterisation}; the
code is able to analyse data in .csv format taken from all three
measurement setups. The main Python file in the code base consists of
three related but independent modules: the first analyses and plots
sensing data from the FET devices, the second analyses and plots
transfer characteristics from channels across a device, and the third
compares individual channel characteristics before and after a
modification or after each of several modifications. The code base also
features a separate config file and style sheet which govern the
behaviour of the main code. The code base was designed collaboratively
by myself and Erica Cassie over GitHub using the Sourcetree Git GUI.
