# Verifying Non-Covalent Functionalisation of Carbon Nanotubes and Graphene

In previous chapters, we have discussed methods of fabricating carbon nanotube and graphene devices and then shown that they can be operated effectively as chemical sensors. However, to detect specific chemical traces while ignoring others ('specific sensing'), the devices require chemical modification, often called 'functionalisation'. Instead of responding to stimuli themselves, the sensing signal is picked up by attached receptors. The devices then act as passive transducers for the received signal. Receptors previously used with carbon nanotube and graphene devices include aptamers and a range of proteins, including odorant receptors. A common approach to attaching receptors to the transducer involves the use of a linker molecule to tether the receptor to the transducer. Verifying that this linker molecule is bridging between the transducer and the receptor element is important for a complete understanding of the behaviour of these sensors. This verification involves providing evidence for effective attachment of linker molecule to the transducing device channel, then showing successful tethering of odorant receptors and other biomolecules to the attached linker molecule.

This chapter therefore takes some time to explore the attachment of linker molecules to carbon nanotube and graphene device channels, using methods such as Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence microscopy and electrical characterisation. Linker molecules used are discussed in detail, and numerous hurdles to successful functionalisation via linker molecules are identified and addressed.

## Non-Covalent Functionalisation & Linker Molecules

Linker molecules may be attached via covalent or non-covalent bonding to carbon nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes and graphene. Non-covalent bonding is weaker and therefore less stable than covalent bonding. However, non-covalent bonding has the advantage of having less of an impact on the structure of a nanomaterial than covalent bonding, and therefore is less likely to negatively affect the electrical properties of the transducer [@Long2012; @DiCrescenzo2014; @Wang2020; @Mishyn2022]. For example, one group found covalent bonding of diazonium linker caused a $\sim 50$%  drop in graphene channel mobility [@Lerner2014]. In comparison, only a $\sim 5$% drop in mobility was seen for attachment of a mixture of linkers containing pyrene to a graphene channel via non-covalent $\pi$ stacking [@Thodkar2021]. 

$\pi$ stacking or $\pi-\pi$ interaction is often used to describe a type of non-covalent bonding which occurs due to dispersion forces between unsaturated polycyclic molecules [@Perez2015]. It has been argued that this label is unhelpfully specific and a misrepresentation of what can be simply classed as a type of Van Der Waals bonding [@Martinez2012; @Perez2015]. However, as the use of the term is widespread in the literature, it is also used here for ease of reference. Carbon nanotubes and graphene consist of a network of carbon atoms attached to each other by sp$^{2}$ hybrid orbitals in a polycyclic structure. They are therefore able to strongly interact with linker molecules with aromatic moieties, such as pyrene [@Hermanson2013-16; @Perez2015; @Mishyn2022]. @fig-pi-interaction-cnt is a visual demonstration of the relationship between the pyrene-based linker molecule with the transducer and receptor elements. $\pi-\pi$ stacking with pyrene is the bonding mechanism underlying all the functionalisation processes in this thesis.

Two conformations of PBASE molecule with geometry optimised via *ab initio* calculations (computed using Gaussian 16 [@g16]). White balls correspond to hydrogen, grey to carbon, red to oxygen and blue to nitrogen. The conformation in (a) has a Hartree-Fock energy of -3427728.67 kJ/mol, while the conformation in (b) has a Hartree-Fock energy of -3427729.66 kJ/mol. The difference between computed Hartree-Fock energies is 1.0 kJ/mol, small enough that the existence of both molecular conformations is physically feasible.

1-Pyrenebutanoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (variously known commercially and in the literature as 1-Pyrenebutyric acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, PBASE, PBSE, PASE, Pyr-NHS, PyBASE, PANHS) is a aromatic, bifunctional molecule commonly used for tethering biomolecules to the carbon rings of graphene and carbon nanotubes. The molecular structure of PBASE is shown in @fig-pbase-structure. The pyrene moiety, seen at the bottom of the molecular structure, non-covalently bonds to the carbon rings of the carbon nanotube and graphene surface. An N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester group is found at the top of the molecular structure, attached to the rest of the molecule via a O-C bond. The NHS ester group is highly reactive with amine groups; it can undergo a nucleophilic substitution reaction with amines attached to proteins or aptamers, tethering these biomolecules via an amide or imide bond [@Chen2001; @Hermanson2013-16; @Hermanson2013-3; @Mishyn2022].

The non-covalent functionalisation of proteins onto a single-walled carbon nanotube using PBASE was first reported by Chen *et al.* in 2001 [@Chen2001]. Two methods for protein functionalisation and immobilisation were successfully used, with the only differences being the solvent used to dissolve the PBASE powder (DMF, methanol) and the final concentration of the resulting solutions (6 mM, 1 mM respectively). The lower concentration may have been used for PBASE in methanol as PBASE powder appears to dissolve poorly in methanol at higher concentrations. Several groups directly cite Chen *et al.* when discussing functionalisation with PBASE [@Cella2010; @Campos2019; @Zheng2016; @Ohno2010]. Other groups using PBASE for graphene or carbon nanotube functionalisation do not explicitly reference Chen *et al.* in their methodology, but it is apparent they often draw on one of these two original methods. This common ancestry becomes apparent from the high frequency of methods detailing the use of 6 mM PBASE in dimethylformamide (DMF) and 1 mM PBASE in methanol, as seen in @tbl-pbase-functionalisation.

 However, it is also apparent from @tbl-pbase-functionalisation that there is a large degree of variation in the methods used for PBASE functionalisation. Various electrical characterisation, microscopy and spectroscopy techniques have been used to demonstrate successful functionalisation. Until recently, there has been little justification provided for the selection of variables used in the functionalisation procedure (e.g. length of time submerged in solvent containing PBASE), despite the wide-ranging use of this process in the literature [@Hinnemo2017; @Zhen2018; @Wang2020]. This is surprising, given that the sensitivity of functionalised devices is considered to be closely related to the density of surface functionalisation [@White2008; @Hermanson2013-3; @Chen2014]. Furthermore, a detailed investigation of PBASE functionalisation process variables has only been undertaken for graphene-based devices [@Zhen2018; @Hao2020; @Wang2020; @Mishyn2022]. 
 
Zhen *et al.*, Wang *et al.* and Mishyn *et al.* claim that carefully tuning the surface concentration of PBASE is required to avoid multilayer coverage of the graphene surface, as this negatively impacts sensing. Mishyn *et al.* use cyclic voltammetry to demonstrate that less receptor attachment to the graphene surface occurs when multiple layers of PBASE are present. However, neither group lends further support to their claim by performing analyte sensing using their functionalised graphene devices [@Zhen2018; @Mishyn2022]. In contrast, Hao *et al.* find that maximising surface coverage of PBASE results in more sensitive aptameric sensing, thus drawing the opposite conclusion [@Hao2020]. The inconsistency in these recent findings mean more work is needed to understand the PBASE functionalisation process to achieve optimal biosensor sensitivity. It may also be the case that a specific functionalisation process is required for optimal sensitivity with the use of a specific type of receptor.

Once fastened to a bioreceptor via an amide or imide bond, the attachment to the linker molecule is not easily broken. However, prior to any functionalisation processes taking place, the NHS ester may react with any water present (hydrolysis), especially at high pH. This reaction converts PBASE to 1-Pyrenebutyric acid (PBA), leaving it unavailable to react further with amine groups [@Hermanson2013-3; @Hermanson2013-5; @Mishyn2022]. If the full functionalisation process is performed within a few hours, with a high concentration of bioreceptor used at close to neutral pH, competing hydrolysis should not have an significantly adverse impact on the functionalisation process [@Hermanson2013-3]. However, if PBASE is exposed to water during storage over a significant length of time, the presence of 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) and N-Hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) is required to restore the NHS ester and enable the substitution reaction to take place (see discussion of EDC in @sec-other-linkers).

We purchased PBASE from two suppliers, Sigma-Aldrich and Setareh Biotech. Sigma recommended DMF and methanol as suitable solvents for dissolving PBASE, alongside chloroform and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Setareh Biotech indicated methanol can be used for dissolving PBASE. The two suppliers had conflicting information for suitable storage of PBASE, with Sigma recommending room temperature storage while Setareh Biotech recommends storage of  $-5$ to $-30 ^\circ \text{C}$ and protection from light and moisture. Given the long travel time of the PBASE samples under uncertain storage conditions, we used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to verify the purity of the PBASE as recieved from each supplier. In light of the negative effect of water on PBASE, in particular we wanted to find out if any water was present in the samples.

@fig-pbase-nmr compares the shapes of hydrogen  (NMR) spectra of PBASE from each supplier when dissolved in deuterated DMSO, alongside a blank deuterated DMSO spectrum. We see both PBASE samples possess characteristic chemical shift features between $2.1-2.2$ ppm, $2.8-2.9$ ppm, and $3.4-3.5$ ppm. The feature at 2.50 ppm represents the deuterated DMSO solvent, while the single peak between $3.3-3.4$ ppm represents the water present in the sample. By comparing the area of these peaks, we can estimate the amount of water originally present in the PBASE sample. The H$_{2}$O:DMSO ratio is 1:7 in the blank spectrum, but $\sim$ 1:3 in the provided samples, possibly indicating the introduction of water to the PBASE during production or storage. However, DMSO is strongly hygroscopic and slight differences in DMSO storage time, as well as differences in  humidity during sample preparation, may have had a significant impact on this result [@Lebel1962]. Other impurities are also seen on both PBASE spectra, though their small size indicates they make up only a small percentage of each sample.
