# Verifying Non-Covalent Functionalisation of Carbon Nanotubes and Graphene

In previous chapters, we have discussed methods of fabricating carbon nanotube and graphene devices and then shown that they can be operated effectively as chemical sensors. However, to detect specific chemical traces while ignoring others ('specific sensing'), the devices require chemical modification, often called 'functionalisation'. Instead of responding to stimuli themselves, the sensing signal is picked up by attached receptors. The devices then act as passive transducers for the received signal. Receptors previously used with carbon nanotube and graphene devices include aptamers and a range of proteins, including odorant receptors. A common approach to attaching receptors to the transducer involves the use of a linker molecule to tether the receptor to the transducer. Verifying that this linker molecule is bridging between the transducer and the receptor element is important for a complete understanding of the behaviour of these sensors. This verification involves providing evidence for effective attachment of linker molecule to the transducing device channel, then showing successful tethering of odorant receptors and other biomolecules to the attached linker molecule.

This chapter therefore takes some time to explore the attachment of linker molecules to carbon nanotube and graphene device channels. The linker molecules used are discussed in detail, and numerous hurdles to successful functionalisation via linker molecules are identified and addressed. Next, it looks at verifying that that the odorant receptor proteins of interest have specifically attached to these linker molecules. The experimental parameters used for both the attachment of linker molecules and receptor proteins are also varied, and the impact of these variations on successful functionalisation is investigated. Verification methods used in this chapter include Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence microscopy and electrical characterisation.

## Non-Covalent Bonding and $\pi$-Stacking

Linker molecules may be attached via covalent or non-covalent bonding to carbon nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes and graphene. Covalent bonding is stronger than non-covalent bonding, and therefore gives a more permanent attachment between linker molecules and the transducer. However, non-covalent bonding has the advantage of having less of an impact on the structure of a nanomaterial than covalent bonding, meaning non-covalent bonding is less likely to negatively affect the electrical properties of the transducer [@Long2012; @DiCrescenzo2014; @Wang2020; @Mishyn2022]. For example, one group found covalent bonding of diazonium linker caused a $\sim 50$%  drop in graphene channel mobility [@Lerner2014]. In comparison, only a $\sim 5$% drop in mobility was seen for attachment of a mixture of linkers containing pyrene to a graphene channel via non-covalent $\pi$ stacking [@Thodkar2021].

$\pi$-stacking or $\pi-\pi$ interaction is often used to describe a type of non-covalent bonding which occurs due to dispersion forces between unsaturated polycyclic molecules [@Perez2015]. It has been argued that this label is unhelpfully specific and a misrepresentation of what can be simply classed as a type of Van Der Waals bonding [@Martinez2012; @Perez2015]. However, as the use of the term is widespread in the literature, it is also used here for ease of reference. Carbon nanotubes and graphene consist of a network of carbon atoms attached to each other by sp$^{2}$ hybrid orbitals in a polycyclic structure. They are therefore able to strongly interact with linker molecules with aromatic moieties, such as pyrene [@Hermanson2013-16; @Perez2015; @Mishyn2022]. @fig-pi-interaction-cnt is a visual demonstration of the relationship between the pyrene-based linker molecule with the transducer and receptor elements.  A wide range of pyrene-based linker molecules have been used for non-covalent modification of carbon nanotubes and graphene [@Zhou2019]. $\pi$-stacking with pyrene is the bonding mechanism underlying all the functionalisation processes in this thesis.

1-Pyrenebutanoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (variously known commercially and in the literature as 1-Pyrenebutyric acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, PBASE, PBSE, PASE, Pyr-NHS, PyBASE, PANHS) is a aromatic molecule commonly used for tethering biomolecules to the carbon rings of graphene and carbon nanotubes. The molecular structure of PBASE is shown in @fig-pbase-structure. Two locally stable molecular conformations were found to exist, a straight (@fig-pbase-stable-1) and bent (@fig-pbase-stable-2)  structure. Similar locally stable structures have previously been computed for PBASE attached to graphene [@Oishi2022]. The pyrene moiety, seen on the left-hand side of @fig-pbase-structure, non-covalently bonds to the carbon rings of the carbon nanotube and graphene surface. The N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester group, seen on the right-hand side of @fig-pbase-structure, is highly reactive with amine groups. It can undergo a nucleophilic substitution reaction with amines attached to proteins or aptamers, tethering these biomolecules via an amide or imide bond [@Chen2001; @Hermanson2013-16; @Hermanson2013-3; @Mishyn2022].

The non-covalent functionalisation of proteins onto a single-walled carbon nanotube using PBASE was first reported by Chen *et al.* in 2001 [@Chen2001]. Two methods for protein functionalisation and immobilisation were successfully used, with the only differences being the solvent used to dissolve the PBASE powder (DMF, methanol) and the final concentration of the resulting solutions (6 mM, 1 mM respectively). The lower concentration may have been used for PBASE in methanol as PBASE powder appears to dissolve poorly in methanol at higher concentrations. Several groups directly cite Chen *et al.* when discussing functionalisation with PBASE [@Besteman2003; @Cella2010; @Campos2019; @Zheng2016; @Ohno2010]. Other groups using PBASE for graphene or carbon nanotube functionalisation do not explicitly reference Chen *et al.* in their methodology, but it is apparent they often draw on one of these two original methods. This common ancestry becomes apparent from the high frequency of methods detailing the use of 6 mM PBASE in dimethylformamide (DMF) and 1 mM PBASE in methanol, as seen in @tbl-pbase-functionalisation.

 However, it is also apparent from @tbl-pbase-functionalisation that there is a large degree of variation in the methods used for PBASE functionalisation. Various electrical characterisation, microscopy and spectroscopy techniques have been used to demonstrate successful functionalisation. Until recently, there has been little justification provided for the selection of variables used in the functionalisation procedure (e.g. length of time submerged in solvent containing PBASE), despite the wide-ranging use of this process in the literature [@Hinnemo2017; @Zhen2018; @Wang2020]. This is surprising, given that the sensitivity of functionalised devices is considered to be closely related to the density of surface functionalisation [@White2008; @Hermanson2013-3; @Chen2014]. Furthermore, a detailed investigation of PBASE functionalisation process variables has only been undertaken for graphene-based devices [@Zhen2018; @Hao2020; @Wang2020; @Mishyn2022]. 
 
Zhen *et al.*, Wang *et al.* and Mishyn *et al.* claim that carefully tuning the surface concentration of PBASE is required to avoid multilayer coverage of the graphene surface, as this negatively impacts sensing. Mishyn *et al.* use cyclic voltammetry to demonstrate that less receptor attachment to the graphene surface occurs when multiple layers of PBASE are present. However, neither group lends further support to their claim by performing analyte sensing using their functionalised graphene devices [@Zhen2018; @Mishyn2022]. In contrast, Hao *et al.* find that maximising surface coverage of PBASE results in more sensitive aptameric sensing, thus drawing the opposite conclusion [@Hao2020]. The inconsistency in these recent findings mean more work is needed to understand the PBASE functionalisation process to achieve optimal biosensor sensitivity. It may also be the case that a specific functionalisation process is required for optimal sensitivity with the use of a specific type of receptor.

:::

Once fastened to a bioreceptor via an amide or imide bond, the attachment to the linker molecule is not easily broken. However, prior to use in functionalisation processes, the NHS ester may react with any water present (hydrolysis). This reaction converts PBASE to 1-pyrenebutyric acid (PBA), leaving it unavailable to react further with amine groups [@Hermanson2013-3; @Hermanson2013-5; @Mishyn2022]. If the amine group functionalisation is performed within a $\sim1$ hour period, with a high concentration of bioreceptor used at close to neutral pH, competing hydrolysis should not have a significantly adverse impact on the functionalisation process [@Hermanson2013-3]. However, if PBASE is exposed to water during storage over a significant length of time, the presence of 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) can be used to restore the NHS ester and enable the substitution reaction to take place (see discussion of PBA/EDC in @sec-PBA).

### Examining 1-Pyrenebutanoic Acid N-Hydroxysuccinimide Ester Purity

We purchased PBASE from two suppliers, Sigma-Aldrich and Setareh Biotech. Sigma recommended DMF and methanol as suitable solvents for dissolving PBASE, alongside chloroform and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Setareh Biotech indicated methanol can be used for dissolving PBASE. The two suppliers had conflicting information for suitable storage of PBASE, with Sigma recommending room temperature storage while Setareh Biotech recommends storage of $-5$ to $-30 ^\circ \text{C}$ and protection from light and moisture. Given the long travel time of the PBASE samples under uncertain storage conditions, we used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to verify the purity of the PBASE as recieved from each supplier. In light of the negative effect of water on PBASE, in particular we wanted to find out if any water was present in the samples.

@fig-pbase-nmr compares the shapes of hydrogen  (NMR) spectra of PBASE from each supplier when dissolved in deuterated DMSO, alongside a blank deuterated DMSO spectrum. We see both PBASE samples possess characteristic chemical shift features between $2.1-2.2$ ppm, $2.8-2.9$ ppm, and $3.4-3.5$ ppm. These chemical shifts roughly correspond to those seen in previous NMR spectra for PBASE [@NMR2]. The feature at 2.50 ppm represents the deuterated DMSO solvent, while the single peak between $3.3-3.4$ ppm represents the water present in the sample. By comparing the area of these peaks, we can estimate the amount of water originally present in the PBASE sample. The H$_{2}$O:DMSO ratio is 1:7 in the blank spectrum, but $\sim$ 1:3 in the provided samples, possibly indicating the introduction of water to the PBASE during production or storage. However, DMSO is strongly hygroscopic and slight differences in DMSO storage time, as well as differences in  humidity during sample preparation, may have had a significant impact on this result [@Lebel1962]. Other impurities are also seen on both PBASE spectra, though their small size indicates they make up only a small percentage of each sample. Note that Strack *et al.* recommend leaving frozen PBASE at room temperature for 15 minutes before opening to prevent the introduction of condensation [@Strack2013].

### Electrical Characterisation

The change in the electrical transfer characteristics of carbon nanotube transistors after being submerged in solvent for one hour and then rinsed thoroughly is demonstrated in (a) and (b), where the solvents used are methanol (MeOH) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) respectively. The change in characteristics of similar transistor channels after being submerged in these same solvents for one hour along with 1 mM PBASE then rinsed are shown in (c) and (d) respectively. Threshold voltages for each transfer characteristic are also shown.
:::

The electrical characteristics of the carbon nanotube or graphene transistor are often used to verify successful functionalisation and make a statement about the effect of chemical modification on the channel. However, this verification usually does not account for the effect of the solvent on the transistor channel. @fig-meoh-only-tx and @fig-dmso-only-tx show that by exposing a steam-deposited carbon nanotube network channel to solvents commonly used in PBASE functionalisation processes (@tbl-pbase-functionalisation), such as methanol (MeOH) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a significant negative shift in channel threshold voltage occurs even after thorough rinsing with deionised water. Besteman *et al.* reported observing a similar effect from prolonged exposure of a single carbon nanotube to dimethylformamide (DMF) [@Besteman2003]. It appears that the carbon nanotubes have adsorped solvent which persists even after device cleaning. From the shape of the change in the transfer curve, it seems the residual polar solvent molecules capacitively gate the channel [@Artyukhin2006; @Heller2008]. 

In contrast, previous work has shown that $\pi$-stacking carbon nanotube network to PBASE does not significantly affect the channel gating and therefore the channel threshold voltage [@Besteman2003; @Murugathas2019b]. Murugathas *et al.* observed a slight increase in channel conductance after PBASE functionalisation when functionalising devices with solvent-deposited CNT films. In @fig-PBASE-vs-solvent-only, we also observe a slight increase in channel conductance post-functionalisation for both @fig-meoh-pbase-tx and @fig-dmso-pbase-tx relative to the solvent-only case in @fig-meoh-only-tx and @fig-dmso-only-tx. It appears that the presence of PBASE molecules increases channel mobility and therefore conductance [@Heller2008].

Capactive gating results from dense coverage of adsorped molecules on the carbon nanotube surface which have a low permittivity relative to the surrounding electrolyte [@Heller2008]. The relative permittivity of MeOH and DMSO are $\sim$ 33 [@Mohsen-Nia2010] and $\sim$ 47 [@Hunger2010] respectively, which are both much lower than the relative permittivity of phosphate buffer saline, $\sim$ 80 [@Shkodra2021]. From @fig-meoh-only-tx and @fig-dmso-only-tx, we find the average threshold shift values resulting from exposure to each solvent were $\Delta$V = $-0.15 \pm 0.03$ V and $\Delta$V = $-0.15 \pm 0.01$ for MeOH and DMSO respectively. The threshold voltage shifts in @fig-meoh-pbase-tx and @fig-dmso-pbase-tx from the pristine are small compared with the devices exposed to solvent only - this is likely due to the effect of increased conductance from the PBASE competing with the gating effect from the residual solvent.

This example illustrates why the use of electrical characteristics when making conclusions around a successful functionalisation process should individually take into account each substance used in the process. The qualitative presence of a change in characteristics (or lack of one) over the full process is not sufficient to make conclusive remarks about the electrical changes due to functionalisation. A full set of electrical control measurements are required for an understanding of electronic changes occuring during the functionalisation process, in the manner of Besteman *et al.* [@Besteman2003].

## Attachment of 1-Pyrenebutyric Acid {#sec-PBA}

### Comparing Attachment Methods

Another linker molecule that can be used to attach receptor molecules to a carbon nanotube or graphene channel is 1-pyrenebutyric acid (PBA). As with PBASE, the pyrene group of PBA has a $\pi$ interaction with the carbon rings of the channel surface. It is possible to react PBA with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC or EDAC) to form an *O*-acylisourea intermediate, which can then react with an amine group on a biomolecule and form an amide bond [@Sehgal1994; @Hermanson2013-4]. The water solubility of EDC means that, unlike PBASE, it is possible to functionalise with EDC dissolved in water rather than in an organic solvent. However, like PBASE, EDC and the *O*-acylisourea intermediate are prone to hydrolysis, especially in acidic conditions. Therefore, like PBASE, it should be stored at −20$^\circ$C, and warmed to room temperature to prevent condensation build-up, since exposure to condensation will hydrolyse the reagent [@Hermanson2013-4]. Furthermore, by adding N-Hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) or N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (sulfo-NHS) to the reaction vessel, PBASE is formed as an active intermediate, which is less prone to hydrolysis and increases the PBA/EDC reaction yield [@Sehgal1994; @Hermanson2013-4; @Hermanson2013-14]. 

From comparing @tbl-pbase-functionalisation and @tbl-pba-functionalisation, we see that PBASE is more widely used for non-covalent functionalisation than PBA/EDC. As was the case for PBASE, there are a wide range of process variables used for the functionalisation process, with little justification used for variables chosen. Also notable is the frequent use of polyethylene glycol (PEG) or pyrene-PEG for prevention of non-specific binding (see @sec-non-specific-binding for further discussion of NSB). Despite being less widely useS, Mishyn *et al.* state a preference for the use of PBA/EDC over PBASE, as they found it was less prone to hydrolysis and gave a larger reaction yield when binding ferrocene to graphene [@Mishyn2022]. A potential downside of using PBA/EDC for protein immobilisation is that EDC has numerous ways of interacting with proteins, and not all of these are necessarily desirable. The addition of NHS may also cause processing issues, such as precipitation of the reaction compound [@Hermanson2013-4]. The greater range of process variables involved in the functionalisation also adds to the complexity of accurately reproducing past results.

###	Raman Spectroscopy

::: {#fig-linker-raman layout="[52.5,47.5]"}

![](figures/ch6/Ned_Raman_bundled.png){#fig-raman-pbase-pba}

Each spectrum shown in (a) corresponds to the average intensity across nine Raman spectra at different locations across a selection of chemically-modified carbon nanotube films. Each spectrum has been normalised so that I$_D$ = 1 (D-peak maximum is unity). (b) shows the distribution of D-band peak to G-band peak ratio (I$_D$/I$_G$) calculated for each of the nine locations on each film.

:::

Raman spectroscopy was used to verify the attachment of PBA to a carbon nanotube network film. The carbon nanotube films used for verifying pyrene attachment were solvent-deposited, as highly-bundled devices were found to give a better optical signal-to-noise ratio, as discussed in @sec-pristine-raman. Droplets of DMSO solution were placed on three (solvent-deposited) carbon nanotube films taken from the same wafer. The DMSO solution on one film contained 5mM PBA, the solution on another film contained 5 mM PBASE, and the DMSO on the final film contained no linker molecule. After incubation for 1 hour, films were rinsed for 15 s with DMSO, then for 15 s with IPA to remove excess DMSO while avoiding hydrolysis of the PBASE. Raman spectroscopy was performed on the films in the manner outlined in @sec-raman-characterisation. The PBA-exposed film was further exposed to 20 mM EDC and 40 mM NHS in 1XPBS electrolyte for 30 minutes, and a second Raman spectra was taken for this film.  The average intensity of Raman shift for each film measurement set is shown in @fig-raman-pbase-pba. The distribution of I$_D$/I$_G$ ratio across all nine Raman spectra from each film measurement set is shown in @fig-raman-comparison.

There is a $\sim 3 \times$ increase in the intensity ratio I$_D$/I$_G$ for both the films modified with PBASE and PBA compared to the film which was only exposed to DMSO. Previous works have found that a change in the intensity ratio indicates successful $\pi$-stacking on the carbon nanotube surface, as it indicates surface modification of the carbon nanotubes has occurred [@Wei2010; @Lan2013]. Wei *et al.* found functionalisation with PBASE altered the ratio by a factor of $\sim 1.5 \times$, while Lan *et al.* found that functionalisation with PBA altered the ratio by a factor of $\sim 0.8 \times$. The reason for the large difference between results is not immediately clear, but may result from the significant differences in the pristine composition and morphology of carbon nanotube networks used in each publication, and differences in the functionalisation method used. We see from @fig-raman-comparison that across all scan locations, there is signficant overlap between I$_D$/I$_G$ measurements for both PBA and PBASE. Furthermore, after further functionalisation of the PBA-modified film with EDC/NHS, subsequent Raman measurements of the film do not differ significantly to measurements taken before adding the EDC/NHS. These results indicate that presence of the NHS ester has little effect on the Raman shift. Therefore, it should be clarified that Raman spectroscopy cannot be used to distinguish between the presence of PBA and PBASE on the device surface.

### Electrical Characterisation

![Electrical transfer characteristics of a carbon nanotube transistor before functionalisation, after being submerged in DMSO containing 5 mM PBA for 1 hour, after being submerged in 1XPBS containing 20 mM EDC and 40 mM NHS for 30 min, then after being submerged in fresh 1XPBS for 1 hour. Threshold voltages for each transfer characteristic are also shown.](figures/ch6/NTQ24C10_ch2_PBA.png){#fig-pba-threshold-shift width="70%"}

@fig-pba-threshold-shift shows the transfer characteristics of a carbon nanotube transistor at various stages of a PBA/EDC functionalisation, where a excess of N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) was added alongside EDC. The device used was fabricated in Jan 2022, where the carbon nanotubes were solvent-deposited. The PBA was dissolved in DMSO, and the device channels were exposed to this solution for 1 hour. Subsequently, it was rinsed with 1XPBS and exposed to 20 mM EDC and 40 mM NHS in 1XPBS electrolyte for 30 minutes. We can compare @fig-pba-threshold-shift to @fig-PBASE-vs-solvent-only for a better understanding of the result of both the PBASE and PBA/EDC functionalisation methods. The threshold shift with the addition of 5 mM PBA in DMSO for 1 hour is equivalent to the shift seen when only DMSO is added, $\Delta$V = -0.15 V. The lack of a significant threshold shift is a result of pyrene having a neutral charge state, and any contributions from the charged carboxyl group being screened from the carbon nanotube sidewalls by surrounding water molecules [@Lerner2012]. However, as in the case of the addition of PBASE, there also appears to be an increase in hole mobility, which may be due to the pyrene groups increasing connectivity within the carbon nanotube network [@Murugathas2019b]. When EDC/NHS is added, a further increase in mobility of channel holes is seen [@Heller2008].

##  Attachment of PEGlyated Pyrene-Based Linkers

### Pyrene-NTA, Pyrene-Biotin and PEGylation

Through chemical coupling/conjugation, it is possible to replace the NHS ester group on PBASE with other groups that can undergo binding reactions with proteins. For example, PBASE can be modified with N$\alpha$,N$\alpha$-Bis(carboxymethyl)-L-lysine hydrate (also known as N-(5-Amino-1-carboxypentyl)iminodiacetic acid, AB-NTA) to produce pyrene-nitrilotriacetic acid (pyrene-NTA). The attached NTA group is able to chelate with metal ions such as Cu$^{2+}$ or Ni$^{2+}$, which then can then coordinate with polyhistidine-tags attached to a protein [@Holzinger2011; @Amano2016]. Functionalisation using the NTA-Ni$^{2+}$ chemistry was successfully used to attach mammalian odorant receptors to a single carbon nanotube for detection of eugenol vapour in real-time [@Goldsmith2011]. Pyrene-biotin (pyrene butanol biotin ester) can also be produced for attaching avidin or strepavidin [@Holzinger2011]. As avidin and strepavidin are tetrameric, they can be attached to both pyrene-biotin and biotinylated avi-tagged proteins simultaneously via strong non-covalent bonding, therefore linking the transducer and receptor [@Star2003a; @Dundas2013; @Hermanson2013-11; @Fairhead2015]. As the presence of his-tags and avi-tags on proteins can be readily controlled, these methods offer improved specificity and directionality over the traditional amide bonding seen earlier.

It is also possible to attach polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains to a pyrene group and modify them with reactive groups such as NTA and biotin to attach proteins in the   manner outlined in the previous paragraph [@Hermanson2013-18; @Meran2018]. Once modified with PEG, the water solubility of pyrene linkers increases, making it possible to perform a full functionalisation procedure exclusively in aqueous solution [@Hermanson2013-18]. By setting the length of the PEG chain, the size of the linker molecule can be controlled - selection of a short chain is important for ensuring attached receptors remain within the Debye length of the transducer [@Shkodra2021]. Functionalisation of a graphene transducer with pyrene-PEG-biotin has previously been used to bind streptavidin to a graphene field-effect transistor device [@Miki2019]. The PEGlyated linkers used in the following sections were purchased pre-prepared. Pyrene-PEG-NTA (2 kDa) was purchased from Nanocs, while pyrene-PEG-FITC (2 kDa, 10 kDa) and pyrene-PEG-biotin (10 kDa) were purchased from Creative PEGworks.

Four 200 $\mu$m $\times$ 200 $\mu$m graphene squares modified with FITC in (a), and with Rhodamine B in (b). In (a), an FITC filter and 6.5 s exposure time was used, and in (b) a Texas Red filter and 1.4 s exposure time was used.

To understand the attachment of PEGlyated pyrene-based linkers to the carbon nanotube or graphene surface, we used pyrene-PEG modified with fluorescein isothiocyanate, a widely-used fluorescent probe which does not specifically interact with carbon rings.  @fig-FITC-rhodamine-B gives a comparison of the presence of FITC and Rhodamine B with four 200 $\mu$m $\times$ 200 $\mu$m graphene squares. There is a much stronger contrast between the graphene squares and the background after functionalisation with Rhodamine B, showing a clear, specific interaction between Rhodamine B and graphene. It has previously been determined that the benzene rings of rhodamine $\pi$-stack with carbon rings [@Tang2012]. As we want to measure the attachment of pyrene, not the fluorescent modifier, we use FITC instead of Rhodamine B. @fig-PPF-concs shows various concentrations of pyrene-PEG-FITC dissolved in 1XPBS, which is used for fluorescence characterisation in this section.

A fluorescence image of a carbon nanotube device encapsulated with SU8 using the pre-2023 mask is shown in (a), using an FITC filter and a 4.5 s exposure time. An image of the same region on this device taken using a shorter exposure time is shown in (b). (c) shows a SU8-encapsulated channel after modification with an aqueous solution of 1 mM Pyrene-PEG-FITC. (d) shows a CNT film coated with SU8, with a 320 $\mu$m $\times$ 320 $\mu$m region of SU8 photolithographically removed to expose the CNTs in that region. (b)-(d) were taken using an FITC filter and a 0.35 s exposure time.

An early difficulty encountered when characterising Pyrene-PEG-FITC attachment (PPF) via fluorescence microscopy is the presence of photoresist. @fig-SU8-only shows an fluoresence image of a carbon nanotube device channel encapsulated with SU8, taken with a FITC filter. The photoresist itself is seen to fluoresce due to its photoactive component [@Pai2007], and therefore a different type of encapsulation would need to be used when verifying channel attachment via fluorescence after encapsulation.Alternative encapsulation methods which can be used with fluorescence microscopy are discussed in @sec-future-work. We also see that the pyrene-PEG-FITC appears to interact with the SU8 surface. @fig-350ms-SU8 and @fig-350ms-SU8-FITC were taken using the same microscope settings (filter, ISO, contrast, exposure time), yet the SU8 exposed to PPF appears much brighter than the pristine SU8. Furthermore, once exposed to PPF we can clearly see photoresist residue on a carbon nanotube film, as shown in @fig-SU8-FITC-CNT. The presence of photoresist residue is not only undesirable for sensing purposes but also interferes with the use of fluorescence microscopy for functionalisation verification. Approaches to dealing with photoresist contamination are outlined in @sec-linker-receptor-attachment.

The graphene film in (a) was not oxygen plasma cleaned before functionalisation, while the graphene film in (b) was oxygen plasma cleaned at 5 W for 15 s at 300 mTorr pressure immediately before functionalisation. Insets show a 10 $\mu$L droplet placed on an unencapsulated carbon nanotube device before (a) and after (b) the same plasma clean procedure.

A second obstacle encountered when verifying the attachment of pyrene-based linker was the hydrophobicity of carbon nanotubes and graphene. As seen in @fig-no-attachment, when a graphene film was submerged in 1XPBS solution containing pyrene-PEG-rhodamine (PPR), the graphene would neither interact with the pyrene or the rhodamine. Instead, we see that the pyrene-PEG-rhodamine interacted exclusively with the surrounding silicon dioxide substrate. We assume that this occurs due to the highly hydrophobic graphene surface repelling surrounding solution, preventing $\pi$-stacking from occurring. However this hydrophobicity is not intrinsic to graphene (or to carbon nanotubes), and instead results from a hydrocarbonaceous layer which forms on the graphene (or carbon nanotube) surface when exposed to air [@Ashraf2014; @Stando2019]. Treatment with oxygen plasma at 5 W for 15 s has previously been found to remove this hydrocarbonaceous layer, restoring the intrinsic hydrophilicity of graphene [@Shin2010]. Furthermore, storing the graphene surface in DI water rather than air prevents the reemergence of the hydrocarbon layer [@Ashraf2014].

Treatment of an unencapsulated carbon nanotube network device at 5 W for 15 s at 300 mTorr greatly reduced the contact angle of a water droplet placed on the device surface, shown inset in @fig-hydrophobicity before and after plasma treatment. A graphene film was then functionalised with pyrene-PEG-rhodamine in 1XPBS in the same manner as for the film in @fig-no-attachment, except with the same plasma treatment performed on the film less than 1 minute before functionalisation. The result is shown in @fig-attachment-post-plasma. We see that the graphene now interacts with the pyrene-PEG-rhodamine. These results both indicate that the plasma treatment is increasing the hydrophilicity of the device surface, improving the ability of pyrene-PEG-rhodamine to $\pi$-stack with graphene. The disadvantage of this procedure is that the plasma cleaning introduces defects to the graphene surface which may be undesirable for device electrical behaviour. It was often found that devices functionalised in this manner had their conductance drop significantly after functionalisation, even though plasma treatment itself did not significantly alter device conductance. Initial functionalisation in solvent was therefore preferred, as it did not require a plasma cleaning step for successful attachment.

The 1000 $\mu$m $\times$ 100 $\mu$m graphene film in image (a) was functionalised with 1 mM pyrene-PEG-FITC in 1XPBS after oxygen plasma treatment, taken using an FITC filter and a 1.6 s exposure time. (b) shows a silicon dioxide surface which had never been exposed to carbon nanotubes, graphene or photoresist after exposure to 1 mM pyrene-PEG-rhodamine in 1XPBS, taken using a Texas Red filter and a 1.8 s exposure time. Graphene films on a substrate functionalised with 1 mM pyrene-PEG-FITC in 1XPBS after oxygen plasma treatment then cleaned with m-CNT dispersion surfactant (NanoIntegris) are shown in (c) and (d), where a FITC filter and 7.5 s exposure time was used.
:::

Another issue that arose when verifying surface functionalisation is that pyrene-PEG interacts with silicon dioxide, making it difficult to discern whether the pyrene group is interacting in a specific manner with the graphene or carbon nanotube film. This can be seen for pyrene-PEG-rhodamine in @fig-hydrophobicity, and also for pyrene-PEG-FITC in @fig-FITC-silicon-dioxide. It was confirmed that pyrene-PEG was interacting with silicon dioxide rather than residual photoresist or nanomaterial by performing a pyrene-PEG-rhodamine functionalisation on pristine silicon dioxide, shown in @fig-rhodamine-silicon-dioxide. The supplier suggested that we thoroughly rinse the surface with surfactant to remove weakly-bound pyrene-PEG-FITC attached to the silicon dioxide, while preserving the pyrene-PEG-FITC strongly attached via $\pi$-stacking to the graphene or carbon nanotube film [@CreativePEGworks2022]. The following process was then used to remove pyrene-PEG-FITC from the silicon dioxide: the film was rinsed with DI water for 30 s, then placed in m-CNT dispersion solution (NanoIntegris) for 5 minutes at 70$^\circ$C while agitating with a pipette, and finally rinsed with DI water, ethanol, acetone, IPA and nitrogen dried. The results of this thorough cleaning process are shown in @fig-PPF-PBS-20X and @fig-PPF-PBS-40X. The majority of pyrene-PEG-FITC has been removed in regions with no graphene, but has remained where graphene is present, indicating specific, $\pi$-stacking interaction is taking place between the pyrene-PEG-FITC and graphene region.
