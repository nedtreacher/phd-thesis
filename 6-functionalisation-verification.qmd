# Verifying Non-Covalent Functionalisation of Carbon Nanotubes and Graphene

In previous chapters, we have discussed methods of fabricating carbon nanotube and graphene devices and then shown that they can be operated effectively as chemical sensors. However, to detect specific chemical traces while ignoring others ('specific sensing'), the devices require chemical modification, often called 'functionalisation'. Instead of responding to stimuli themselves, the sensing signal is picked up by attached receptors. The devices then act as passive transducers for the received signal. Receptors previously used with carbon nanotube and graphene devices include aptamers and a range of proteins, including odorant receptors. A common approach to attaching receptors to the transducer involves the use of a linker molecule to tether the receptor to the transducer. Verifying that this linker molecule is bridging between the transducer and the receptor element is important for a complete understanding of the behaviour of these sensors. This verification involves providing evidence for effective attachment of linker molecule to the transducing device channel, then showing successful tethering of odorant receptors and other biomolecules to the attached linker molecule.

This chapter therefore takes some time to explore the attachment of linker molecules to carbon nanotube and graphene device channels, using methods such as Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence microscopy and electrical characterisation. Linker molecules used are discussed in detail, and numerous hurdles to successful functionalisation via linker molecules are identified and addressed.

## Non-Covalent Functionalisation & Linker Molecules

Linker molecules may be attached via covalent or non-covalent bonding to carbon nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes and graphene. Non-covalent bonding is weaker than covalent bonding. However, non-covalent bonding has the advantage of having a smaller impact on the structure of a nanomaterial than covalent bonding, and therefore having less of a negative effect on the electrical properties of the transducer [@Long2012; @DiCrescenzo2014]. For example, one group found covalent bonding of diazonium linker caused a $\sim 50$%  drop in graphene channel mobility [@Lerner2014]. In comparison, only a $\sim 5$% drop in mobility was seen for attachment of a mixture of linkers containing pyrene to a graphene channel via non-covalent $\pi$ stacking [@Thodkar2021]. 

$\pi$ stacking or $\pi-\pi$ interaction is often used to describe a particularly strong type of non-covalent bonding which occurs due to dispersion forces between unsaturated polycyclic molecules. It has been argued that this label is unhelpfully specific and a misrepresentation of what can be simply classed as a type of Van Der Waals bonding. However, as the use of the term is widespread in the literature it is also used here for ease of reference. Carbon nanotubes and graphene consist of a network of carbon atoms attached to each other by sp$^{2}$ hybrid orbitals in a polycyclic structure. They are therefore able to interact with linker molecules with aromatic moieties, such as pyrene. @fig-pi-interaction-cnt is a visual demonstration of the relationship between the pyrene-based linker molecule with the transducer and receptor elements. $\pi-\pi$ stacking with pyrene is the bonding mechanism underlying all the functionalisation processes in this thesis.

Two conformations of PBASE molecule with geometry optimised via *ab initio* calculations (computed using Gaussian 16 [@g16]). White balls correspond to hydrogen, grey to carbon, red to oxygen and blue to nitrogen. The conformation in (a) has a Hartree-Fock energy of -3427728.67 kJ/mol, while the conformation in (b) has a Hartree-Fock energy of -3427729.66 kJ/mol. The difference between computed Hartree-Fock energies is 1.0 kJ/mol, small enough that the existence of both molecular conformations is physically possible.

1-Pyrenebutanoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (variously known commercially and in the literature as 1-Pyrenebutyric acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, PBASE, PBSE, PASE, Pyr-NHS, PyBASE, PANHS) is a aromatic, bifunctional molecule commonly used for tethering biomolecules to the carbon rings of graphene and carbon nanotubes. The molecular structure of PBASE is shown in @fig-pbase-structure. 

The non-covalent functionalisation of proteins onto a single-walled carbon nanotube using PBASE was first reported by Chen *et al.* in 2001 [@Chen2001]. Two methods for protein functionalisation and immobilisation were successfully used, with the only differences being the solvent used to dissolve the PBASE powder (DMF, methanol) and the final concentration of the resulting solutions (6 mM, 1 mM respectively). The lower concentration may have been used for PBASE in methanol as PBASE powder appears to dissolve poorly in methanol at higher concentrations. Cella *et al.*, Campos *et al.*, Zheng *et al.* and Ohno *et al.* all directly cite Chen *et al.* when discussing functionalisation with PBASE [@Cella2010; @Campos2019; @Zheng2016; @Ohno2010]. Other groups using PBASE for graphene or carbon nanotube functionalisation do not explicitly reference Chen *et al.* in their methodology, but it is apparent they often draw on one of these two original methods. This common ancestry becomes apparent from the high frequency of methods detailing the use of 6 mM PBASE in DMF and 1 mM PBASE in methanol, as seen in @tbl-pbase-functionalisation.

 However, it is also apparent from @tbl-pbase-functionalisation that there is a large degree of variation in the methods used for PBASE functionalisation. Various electrical characterisation, microscopy and spectroscopy techniques have been used to demonstrate successful functionalisation. However, there has historically been little  justification provided for the exact parameters used in the procedure. As noted by Zhen *et al.* and Hinnemo *et al.*,  there is more generally a lack of systematic research into formation of pyrene-derivative monolayers on graphene and other carbon nanomaterials, despite the wide use of this chemistry in the literature [@Zhen2018; @Hinnemo2017].

We purchased PBASE from two suppliers, Sigma-Aldrich and Setareh Biotech. Sigma recommended DMF and methanol as suitable solvents for dissolving PBASE alongside chloroform and DMSO. Setareh Biotech indicated methanol can be used for dissolving PBASE. The two suppliers had conflicting information for suitable storage of PBASE, with Sigma recommending room temperature storage while Setareh Biotech recommends storage of  $-5$ to $-30 ^\circ \text{C}$ and protection from light and moisture. @fig-pbase-nmr compares the shapes of NMR spectra of PBASE from each supplier dissolved in DMSO, alongside a blank DMSO spectrum.
