# Conclusions and Future Work

## Conclusions {#sec-conclusions}

### General Overview

- key results

### Biosensor Performance and Transducer Morphology 

- graphene folds
- density of carbon nanotube network, ratio of metallic to semiconducting tubes, nanotube bundle diameters
- metallic cnts and bundled CNTs more reactive
- carbon nanotube junctions
- bundle heights can be measured with AFM and modelled using normal or skew-normal distributions

- mean bundle diameter for solvent-deposited device $9.1\pm4.0$ nm, equivalent to 30 carbon nanotubes in a 2D packed cylinder, while mean bundle diameter for surfactant-deposited device $4.1\pm2.0$ nm, equivalent to 5 nanotubes in a 2D packed cylinder: the repulsive surfactant adsorbs to nanotubes and prevents carbon nanotubes fron bundling together in solution, some bundling appears to occur during deposition maybe due to outward capillary flow of coffee-ring effect
- Introducing steam while depositing carbon nanotubes increases nanotube coverage from below 50% to 70%, but leaves surfactant
- Raman: Average $I_D/I_G$ ratio increases for surfactant-deposited films due to the introduction of defects due to surfactant, lower splitting between G$^-$ and G$^+$ peaks indicates more metallic nanotubes in surfactant-deposited networks
- Steam/surfactant deposited devices showed less variability in on-off ratio due to their dense morphology, where small variations have less impact on electrical behaviour, desirable for reproducibility and multiplexed sensing 
- Steam/surfactant deposited devices had a relatively large average on-off ratio (> 100) and subthreshold slope ($\sim$ 7 dec V$^{-1}$) due to being less bundled, which corresponds to low power consumption
- transconductance lowered for surfactant-deposited devices ($\sim$ 1 µS vs > 2 µS)

- devices shown to be sensitive to PBS additions (a flow cell may be needed to increase sensitivity) and adsorption of vapour


### Biosensor Drift and Transducer Hysteresis

- charge traps from gate bias or dopant adsorption
- baseline drift due to changes in trap states
- 3 hour signal drift followed by steady-state, reversible and modelled with three exponentials
- hysteresis increases with bundle diameter due to trapped charge increasing, surfactant-deposited devices preferable
- hysteresis significantly affected by the presence of water when backgated due to introduced charge traps

- baseline drift linear term was consistent between channels on a single device with mean value of $-6.1 \pm 1.2$ pAs^{-1}, indicating long-term drift consistent between channels fabricated in the same manner

- Largest time constant for short-term exponential drift term for pristine liquid-gated device up to $\tau = 610 \pm 30$ s, pristine back-gated was $\tau = 730 \pm 10$ s (1800 s and 2400 s control series appropriate)

- pristine back-gated device drift more significant for both linear and exponential term


### Biosensor Functionalisation and Transducer Cleanliness

- threshold voltage shift compares gating behaviour of devices
- most functionalisation procedures used to attach odorant receptors are non-covalent
- more consistent limit of detection for covalent attachment
- all vapour sensing with nanodiscs has used covalent functionalisation 
- non-specific binding: misoriented attachment, substrate attachment  
- non-covalent functionalisation $-$ $\sim$ 7 ppb by Goldsmith *et al.*

- AFM evidence for adsorped water vapour and/or surfactant, long histogram tail more than 5 nm in height
- Raman evidence for adsorped water vapour and/or surfactant, $I_{D}/I_{G}$ ratio increased for steam-assisted surfactant deposited device
- graphene devices seen to be slightly $p$-doped from their rightwards shifted major Dirac point, could be adsorbed photoresist
- steam-assisted surfactant-deposited devices heavily $p$-doped, average $V_t$ = 0.37 V relative to $V_t$ = 0.27 V for solvent-deposited, could be resist, steam adsorption or surfactant residue


- devices shown to be sensitive to PBS additions (electrostatic gating) and adsorption of vapour, however direct charge transfer may not be involved!!! just because a device is sensitive does not mean it is clean and functionalisable

- unclear whether dense PBASE surface coverage is desirable, possible that the use of an excessive PBASE or PBA concentration leads to multilayer coverage which reduces the quality of functionalisation

-MeOH and DMSO can both be adsorbed to the channel, causing a change in transfer characteristics due to capacitive gating

- Raman and pyrene-PEG-FITC fluorescence microscopy showed that pyrene linker was attaching to the channel

- PEG or pyrene-PEG often used for the prevention of non-specific binding

- biomolecules will preferentially stick to residual resist over the channel if not sufficiently hardbaked, shown with fluorescence microscopy

- long-chain alkanes from air make channel hydrophobic and repel functionalisation material in aqueous solution, can be removed with low power plasma

-non-specific binding occurs between pyrene-based linker and the SiO$_2$ substrate


## Future Work {#sec-future-work}

### Device Fabrication and Functionalisation {#sec-future-work-fabrication}

#### Improved Encapsulation {.unnumbered}

Ceramic encapsulation with HfO$_2$ (see ceramic encapsulation paper)

Need special SU8 as SU8-2150 and AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 photoresist both fluoresce

use previous OR fluorescence test paper with PEG and GFP-ORs to check for successful passivation of SiO$_2$

could also use PEG-FITC and GFP-ORs to check for passivation of unmodified carbon nanotubes (without GFP-ORs)

#### Surface Contamination {.unnumbered}

Could model surface contamination using a linear combination of normal or skew-normal distributions [@Marchenko2010]. Alternatively, could improve microscopy and get closer to normal distribution by altering the force applied by microscope tip [@Vobornik2023]. 

Thermal oxidation [@Kane2014; @Barnett2018], cleaning with oxygen radicals [@Petkov2005]


#### Covalent Approaches {.unnumbered}

- use of Cu2+/AB-NTA (Nα,Nα-Bis(carboxymethyl)-L-lysine hydrate) with diazonium salt used to functionalise single carbon nanotube for detection of eugenol vapour in real-time [@Goldsmith2011]

NTA chelates with metal ions, with a particularly strong bond to Cu$^{2+}$ [@Chang2017]

- use of antibody fragments

- systematic comparison of the effectiveness of different covalent techniques (quality of functionalisation vs channel mobility post-functionalisation)

#### Investigating OR-ORCO Complex {.unnumbered}

- Lim *et al.* [@Jin2012; @Park2012a; @Lim2014; @Lim2015; @Son2015; @Ahn2015] but with ORCO ion channel and iOR in liposomes instead of Kir potassium ion channel and hOR

- Could try using sodium, calcium and potassium ions just as the ORCO channel does *in vivo*, (also VUAA1), gives a better idea of the behaviour and role of ORCO [@Wicher2021]

- are other intracellular components or ion channels required for operation??

#### Multiplexing {.unnumbered}

A scent in nature contains a mixture of many different volatile organic compounds in vapour at different concentrations. A major goal for a vapour-phase iOR biosensor is therefore to perform multiplexed measurements with different iORs in different channels to simultaneously measure and distinguish between mixtures of volatile organic compounds [@Kwon2015; @Hurot2020; @Hirata2021]. A similar approach could be taken to that of Kwon *et al.* and Son *et al.*, but for insect odorant receptors [@Kwon2015; @Son2017]. A difficulty that could arise here is that iORs may specifically bind with multiple VOCs. When interacting with an iOR, different volatiles can 'antagonise' each other; some iORs will not respond to a positive ligand if another specific ligand is present [@Kwon2015; @Munch2016; @Son2017; @Hirata2021]. This means a multiplexed iOR biosensor would first need to be tested individually against different volatile compounds, and then with mixtures of volatile compounds to detect any antagonistic behaviours in a systematic manner. Care should be taken to avoid the coffee-ring effect when functionalising individual channels of a device (@sec-coffee-ring). The use of small, deep microchannels in clean PDMS, which keep functionalisation material close to the channel, may be essential for consistent functionalisation.

### Vapour Sensing {#sec-future-work-vapour}

#### Flow System {.unnumbered}

Replace all three mass flow controllers with two MFCs with maximum flow both equal to either 1000 or 10000 sccm. One MFC should be kept at a constant flow rate through the dilution line at all times during a sensing experiment. The other should also be kept at a constant flow rate at all times, but feed into a computer-automated solenoid valve which is able to switch the flow between multiple lines. Under normal operation, this second MFC should also be directed through the dilution line. During a sensing series, it should then be redirected through the carrier line. 

More consistent, used by Goldsmith *et al.*

May need to replace PVC with stainless steel tubing, introduce a vapour trap to the system before the vacuum pump for use with more corrosive volatile compounds able to significantly degrade PVC at low concentrations

#### Capture Layer {.unnumbered}

Insect odorant receptors are stabilised by having their lipid membrane maintained in an aqueous environment. Exposing iORs to vapour-phase compounds outside this environment may cause them significant damage without the use of a protective membrane protein [@Sato2014; @Warden2019]. A capture layer can be used to mimic the mucus within the insect sensillum lymph, which protects the dendrite cells [@Sato2014; @Hurot2020; @Cali2020; @Shkodra2021]. This capture layer could also be used as a liquid-gate to maximise device sensitivity. A gate electrode can be photolithographically patterned onto the device surface alongside the source and drain electrodes for this purpose, making contact with the capture layer through an additional gap in the device encapsulation [@Shkodra2021]. Only slight alterations would have to be made to the device design outlined in this thesis for implementation. 

A variety of possible capture layer solutions for vapour-phase field-effect transistor sensors can be found in the literature. Lee *et al.* and Kuznetsov *et al.* integrated an aqueous membrane held by polycarbonate and SiO$_2$/Si$_3$N$_4$/SiO$_2$ into their sensor, which prevented electrolyte evaporation [@Lee2015; @Kuznetsov2018]. Bio-gels or ionic liquids (ILs) are other potential candidates. Sato *et al.* used an agarose hydrogel in a microchamber array as a capture layer [@Sato2014; @Hirata2021]. Ionic liquids have low vapour pressure, high capacitance, as well as high electrochemical stability. Hwang *et al.* and White *et al.* used 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (BMIM) as the electrolytic gate for thin-film field-effect transistors [@Hwang2014; @White2015]. Alternative ionic liquid candidates may need to be identified which are biologically compatible. 

A potential difficulty with this approach might be ensuring rapid odorant diffusion through the layer to the iOR-FET surface, especially when compounds are insoluble [@Pelosi2018; @Warden2019; @Cali2020; @Hurot2020; @Yamada2021; @Spencer2021]. Yamada *et al.* used hydrophobic microslits at the liquid-vapour interface to promote mixing of compounds within an aqueous environment [@Yamada2021]. It may also be possible to use odorant binding proteins to carry volatile compounds to the odorant receptors, just as *Drosophilia Melanogaster* does *in vivo* [@Larisika2015; @Brito2016; @Sankaran2011; @Kotlowski2018; @Pelosi2018; @Cali2020].

 #### Multiplexing {.unnumbered}

![Breakout board for vapour delivery system device. Source electrode terminals are labelled S, drain electrode terminals are labelled D, the gate electrode terminal is labelled G and disconnected terminals are labelled 0. Each number corresponds to a different device channel.](figures/ch9/multiplex-breakout.png){#fig-vapour-sensor-breakout}

already possible to connect four channels at once through custom breakout board, sufficient to test three ORs simultaneously alongside empty ORs

![Multiplexing with a second analyte bottle and four-way valve.](figures/ch9/multiplex-vapoursensor.png){#fig-vapour-sensor multiplexing}

Install a second analyte bottle branching off from the existing carrier line, place 4-way valve after analyte bottles which runs one analyte bottle to exhaust and one to chamber

Can alternate between analyte and nitrogen with flow through the analyte bottle, and therefore the amount of vapour passing out of the bottle, largely unchanged across a sensing run

Can alternate between two analytes (control analyte and response analyte) with flow through each uninterrupted

Each carrier line only ever contains one analyte, to prevent cross-contamination between lines. 

With a 16-way or 32-way valve, more analyte bottles could be added and therefore multiplexing with more ORs in a single experimental run
