A scent in nature contains a mixture of many different volatile organic compounds in vapour at different concentrations. A major goal for a vapour-phase iOR biosensor is therefore to perform multiplexed measurements with different iORs in different channels to simultaneously measure and distinguish between mixtures of volatile organic compounds [@Kwon2015; @Hurot2020; @Hirata2021]. A similar approach could be taken to that of Son *et al.*, but for insect odorant receptors [@Son2017]. A difficulty that could arise here is that iORs may specifically bind with multiple VOCs. When interacting with an iOR, different volatiles can 'antagonise' each other; some iORs will not respond to a volatile compound if another specific compound is present [@Kwon2015; @Munch2016; @Son2017; @Hirata2021]. This means a multiplexed iOR biosensor would first need to be tested individually against different volatile compounds, and then with mixtures of volatile compounds to detect any antagonistic behaviours in a systematic manner. This approach towards ensuring selectivity should also be taken towards the creation of multiplexed devices more generally [@Shkodra2021].

### Vapour Sensing {#sec-future-work-vapour}

#### System Layout {.unnumbered}

Replace all three mass flow controllers with two MFCs with maximum flow both equal to either 1000 or 10000 sccm. One MFC should be kept at a constant flow rate through the dilution line at all times during a sensing experiment. The other should also be kept at a constant flow rate at all times, but feed into a computer-automated solenoid valve which is able to switch the flow between multiple lines. Under normal operation, this second MFC should also be directed through the dilution line. During a sensing series, it should then be redirected through one of a series of carrier lines. Each carrier line only ever contains one analyte, to prevent cross-contamination between lines. 

#### Device Configuration {.unnumbered}

Insect odorant receptors are stabilised by having their lipid membrane maintained in an aqueous environment. Exposing iORs to vapour-phase compounds outside this environment may cause them significant damage without the use of a protective membrane protein [@Sato2014; @Warden2019]. A capture layer can be used to mimic the mucus within the insect sensillum lymph, which protects the dendrite cells [@Sato2014; @Hurot2020; @Cali2020; @Shkodra2021]. This capture layer could also be used as a liquid-gate to maximise device sensitivity. A gate electrode can be photolithographically patterned onto the device surface alongside the source and drain electrodes for this purpose, making contact with the capture layer through an additional gap in the device encapsulation [@Shkodra2021]. Only slight alterations would have to be made to the device design outlined in this thesis for implementation. A potential difficulty with this approach might be ensuring rapid odorant diffusion through the layer to the iOR-FET surface, especially when compounds are insoluble [@Pelosi2018; @Warden2019; @Cali2020; @Hurot2020; @Yamada2021; @Spencer2021]. Yamada *et al.* used hydrophobic microslits at the liquid-vapour interface to promote mixing of compounds within an aqueous environment [@Yamada2021]. 

A variety of possible capture layer solutions for vapour-phase field-effect transistor sensors can be found in the literature. Lee *et al.* and Kuznetsov *et al.* integrated an aqueous membrane held by polycarbonate and SiO$_2$/Si$_3$N$_4$/SiO$_2$ into their sensor, which prevented electrolyte evaporation [@Lee2015; @Kuznetsov2018]. Bio-gels or ionic liquids (ILs) are other potential candidates. Sato *et al.* used an agarose hydrogel in a microchamber array as a capture layer [@Sato2014; @Hirata2021]. Ionic liquids have low vapour pressure, high capacitance, as well as high electrochemical stability. Hwang *et al.* and White *et al.* used 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (BMIM) as the electrolytic gate for thin-film field-effect transistors [@Hwang2014; @White2015]. Alternative ionic liquid candidates may need to be identified which are biologically compatible.
