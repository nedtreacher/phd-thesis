# Conclusions and Future Work

## Conclusions {#sec-conclusions}

### General Overview

I started writing this thesis with one broad aim $-$ to couple insect odorant receptors with either a carbon nanotube or graphene field-effect transistor for highly selective sensing in the vapour phase. Through this process, I hoped to gain new physical insights into the transducer and receptor elements used, through careful examination of the biosensors which resulted from their coupling. At the end of this investigation, three broad themes have emerged:

- Slight variations in transducer morphology have a substantial impact on biosensor sensitivity and power consumption.

- Intrinsic transducer hysteresis leads to biosensor current drift, which can be modelled and corrected for when interpreting sensing data.

- Surface contamination can affect transducer functionalisation and lead to significant variability in biosensor quality.

These findings and their relation to the goal of creating a reliable biosensor for a vapour-phase detection system are each detailed in this section.

### Biosensor Performance and Transducer Morphology 

Carbon nanotube networks and graphene are used as the thin-film for sensing field-effect transistors due to their highly sensitive surface. Features present on each film were found to enhance or reduce the sensitivity of the transistor in a low-power configuration. The process used for randomly depositing carbon nanotubes influences multiple aspects of the resulting network morphology, including the density and homogeneity of the network, the diameter of bundled carbon nanotubes, the level of doping present and the relative proportion of metallic to semiconducting nanotubes. These variables were investigated atomic force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and electrical characterisation. Devices with carbon nanotubes deposited using surfactant in the presence of steam were found to have relatively dense and homogeneous networks which gave rise to highly consistent electrical characteristics, desirable for biosensor reproducibility and multiplexing. Carbon nanotube bundle diameters were also much smaller in these networks, which gave them a relatively large on-off ratio and subthreshold slope, figures of merit which correspond to low power operation. However, steam-assisted surfactant-deposited devices were found to have significant $p$-doping, possibly from surfactant. Removing the source of this $p$-doping would further enhance the sensitive and low power performance of these devices.

### Biosensor Drift and Transducer Hysteresis

All devices characterised showed a degree of hysteresis, which was especially significant for solvent-deposited carbon nanotube network devices as well as any device when backgated. This hysteresis is a result of the evolving occupancy of charge traps, which are introduced to the device by gate bias or adsorbed dopants. This changing occupancy leads to a slow drift in current level when the transistor is operated with constant voltages at both the drain and gate. If left until reaching a steady state, this baseline drift can be modelled using a linear combination of three exponentials. However, it is not feasible to wait more than three hours for a biosensor to warm up with each use. A series expansion was used to model the drift over a shorter period of time, where the two longer time constant exponentials were approximated as linear. This meant only having to wait until the first exponential had decayed before sensing, which typically took <30 minutes for a pristine, liquid-gated steam-deposited carbon nanotube device. Each exponential term may correspond to charge traps introduced at different stages of fabrication and functionalisation. For example, long-term drift was consistent across channels fabricated simultaneously, but appeared to be affected by functionalisation.

### Biosensor Functionalisation and Transducer Contamination

While the pristine surfactant-deposited carbon nanotube transistors were consistently sensitive to changes in both an aqueous and vapour environment, their selective detection ability after non-covalent functionalisation with iORs was highly variable. Using atomic force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, electrical characterisation and fluorescence microscopy it was found that the PBASE linker was successfully attaching iOR nanodiscs to the carbon nanotube network. While functionalisation caused significant gating of the network for devices which were successful sensors, it was not seen for devices which showed no selective sensing behaviour, despite the evidence that iOR nanodiscs were present in both cases. It was therefore hypothesised that an unknown coating on the transducer was allowing iOR nanodiscs to stick to the network, but not form a direct electrical connection. A pristine carbon nanotube device with such a coating could still be highly sensitive to electrostatic or capacitive gating. However, it has previously been noted that the primary sensing mechanism of iORs appears to be through direct charge transfer. If an insulating coating layer is present, it may prevent charge from passing between the iORs and the channel. 

Multiple potential candidates for this unwanted coating were identified throughout the course of this thesis, including residual surfactant, solvent or photoresist, multilayer or hydrolysed PBASE and hydrophobic long-chain alkanes. Sensing experiments were then performed that systematically eliminated possible candidates. It was found that neither avoiding the introduction of surfactant or ensuring PBASE did not hydrolyse led to consistent biosensors. Finally, a method was tested that eliminated the remaining possible candidates through the use of a oxygen plasma clean step prior to functionalisation, as well as the use of iORs in surfactant solution with linker pre-attached. This process resulted in a successful sensor in an aqueous environment, which is further indication that either photoresist residue, a hydrocarbon coating, a PBASE layer or the membrane format of iORs is the cause of sensor variability. The impact of oxygen plasma on device mobility and the vunerability of the unprotected iORs means that this method does produce reliable vapour-phase sensors. A covalent, directionally-oriented method of immobilising nanodiscs could be used instead, which has previously been successful for vapour-phase biosensing with mORs. Alternatively, a less destructive cleaning process could be identified to ensure consistent non-covalent functionalisation, used alongside a bio-friendly vapour capture layer for vapour-phase sensing without the use of nanodiscs.

Ceramic encapsulation with HfO$_2$ (see ceramic encapsulation paper)

Need special SU8 as SU8-2150 and AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 photoresist both fluoresce

use previous OR fluorescence test paper with PEG and GFP-ORs to check for successful passivation of SiO$_2$

could also use PEG-FITC and GFP-ORs to check for passivation of unmodified carbon nanotubes (without GFP-ORs)

#### Surface Contamination {.unnumbered}

Could model surface contamination using a linear combination of normal or skew-normal distributions [@Marchenko2010]. Alternatively, could improve microscopy and get closer to normal distribution by altering the force applied by microscope tip [@Vobornik2023]. 

Thermal oxidation [@Kane2014; @Barnett2018], cleaning with oxygen radicals [@Petkov2005]


#### Covalent Approaches {.unnumbered}

- use of Cu2+/AB-NTA (Nα,Nα-Bis(carboxymethyl)-L-lysine hydrate) with diazonium salt used to functionalise single carbon nanotube for detection of eugenol vapour in real-time [@Goldsmith2011]

NTA chelates with metal ions, with a particularly strong bond to Cu$^{2+}$ [@Chang2017]

- use of antibody fragments

- systematic comparison of the effectiveness of different covalent techniques (quality of functionalisation vs channel mobility post-functionalisation)

#### Investigating OR-ORCO Complex {.unnumbered}

- Lim *et al.* [@Jin2012; @Park2012a; @Lim2014; @Lim2015; @Son2015; @Ahn2015] but with ORCO ion channel and iOR in liposomes instead of Kir potassium ion channel and hOR

- Could try using sodium, calcium and potassium ions just as the ORCO channel does *in vivo*, (also VUAA1), gives a better idea of the behaviour and role of ORCO [@Wicher2021]

- are other intracellular components or ion channels required for operation??

#### Multiplexing {.unnumbered}

A scent in nature contains a mixture of many different volatile organic compounds in vapour at different concentrations. A major goal for a vapour-phase iOR biosensor is therefore to perform multiplexed measurements with different iORs in different channels to simultaneously measure and distinguish between mixtures of volatile organic compounds [@Kwon2015; @Hurot2020; @Hirata2021]. A similar approach could be taken to that of Kwon *et al.* and Son *et al.*, but for insect odorant receptors [@Kwon2015; @Son2017]. A difficulty that could arise here is that iORs may specifically bind with multiple VOCs. When interacting with an iOR, different volatiles can 'antagonise' each other; some iORs will not respond to a positive ligand if another specific ligand is present [@Kwon2015; @Munch2016; @Son2017; @Hirata2021]. This means a multiplexed iOR biosensor would first need to be tested individually against different volatile compounds, and then with mixtures of volatile compounds to detect any antagonistic behaviours in a systematic manner. Care should be taken to avoid the coffee-ring effect when functionalising individual channels of a device (@sec-coffee-ring). The use of small, deep microchannels in clean PDMS, which keep functionalisation material close to the channel, may be essential for consistent functionalisation.

### Vapour Sensing {#sec-future-work-vapour}

#### Flow System {.unnumbered}

Replace all three mass flow controllers with two MFCs with maximum flow both equal to either 1000 or 10000 sccm. One MFC should be kept at a constant flow rate through the dilution line at all times during a sensing experiment. The other should also be kept at a constant flow rate at all times, but feed into a computer-automated solenoid valve which is able to switch the flow between multiple lines. Under normal operation, this second MFC should also be directed through the dilution line. During a sensing series, it should then be redirected through the carrier line. 

More consistent, used by Goldsmith *et al.*

May need to replace PVC with stainless steel tubing, introduce a vapour trap to the system before the vacuum pump for use with more corrosive volatile compounds able to significantly degrade PVC at low concentrations

#### Capture Layer {.unnumbered}

Insect odorant receptors are stabilised by having their lipid membrane maintained in an aqueous environment. Exposing iORs to vapour-phase compounds outside this environment may cause them significant damage without the use of a protective membrane protein [@Sato2014; @Warden2019]. A capture layer can be used to mimic the mucus within the insect sensillum lymph, which protects the dendrite cells [@Sato2014; @Hurot2020; @Cali2020; @Shkodra2021]. This capture layer could also be used as a liquid-gate to maximise device sensitivity. A gate electrode can be photolithographically patterned onto the device surface alongside the source and drain electrodes for this purpose, making contact with the capture layer through an additional gap in the device encapsulation [@Shkodra2021]. Only slight alterations would have to be made to the device design outlined in this thesis for implementation. 

A variety of possible capture layer solutions for vapour-phase field-effect transistor sensors can be found in the literature. Lee *et al.* and Kuznetsov *et al.* integrated an aqueous membrane held by polycarbonate and SiO$_2$/Si$_3$N$_4$/SiO$_2$ into their sensor, which prevented electrolyte evaporation [@Lee2015; @Kuznetsov2018]. Bio-gels or ionic liquids (ILs) are other potential candidates. Sato *et al.* used an agarose hydrogel in a microchamber array as a capture layer [@Sato2014; @Hirata2021]. Ionic liquids have low vapour pressure, high capacitance, as well as high electrochemical stability. Hwang *et al.* and White *et al.* used 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (BMIM) as the electrolytic gate for thin-film field-effect transistors [@Hwang2014; @White2015]. Alternative ionic liquid candidates may need to be identified which are biologically compatible. 

A potential difficulty with this approach might be ensuring rapid odorant diffusion through the layer to the iOR-FET surface, especially when compounds are insoluble [@Pelosi2018; @Warden2019; @Cali2020; @Hurot2020; @Yamada2021; @Spencer2021]. Yamada *et al.* used hydrophobic microslits at the liquid-vapour interface to promote mixing of compounds within an aqueous environment [@Yamada2021]. It may also be possible to use odorant binding proteins to carry volatile compounds to the odorant receptors, just as *Drosophilia Melanogaster* does *in vivo* [@Larisika2015; @Brito2016; @Sankaran2011; @Kotlowski2018; @Pelosi2018; @Cali2020].

 #### Multiplexing {.unnumbered}

![Breakout board for vapour delivery system device. Source electrode terminals are labelled S, drain electrode terminals are labelled D, the gate electrode terminal is labelled G and disconnected terminals are labelled 0. Each number corresponds to a different device channel.](figures/ch9/multiplex-breakout.png){#fig-vapour-sensor-breakout}

already possible to connect four channels at once through custom breakout board, sufficient to test three ORs simultaneously alongside empty ORs

![Multiplexing with a second analyte bottle and four-way valve.](figures/ch9/multiplex-vapoursensor.png){#fig-vapour-sensor multiplexing}

Install a second analyte bottle branching off from the existing carrier line, place 4-way valve after analyte bottles which runs one analyte bottle to exhaust and one to chamber

Can alternate between analyte and nitrogen with flow through the analyte bottle, and therefore the amount of vapour passing out of the bottle, largely unchanged across a sensing run

Can alternate between two analytes (control analyte and response analyte) with flow through each uninterrupted

Each carrier line only ever contains one analyte, to prevent cross-contamination between lines. 

With a 16-way or 32-way valve, more analyte bottles could be added and therefore multiplexing with more ORs in a single experimental run
