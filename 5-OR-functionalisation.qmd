#   Functionalisation of Carbon Nanotubes and Graphene with Odorant Receptors

## Linker molecules

### 1-Pyrenebutanoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (PBASE)

1-Pyrenebutanoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (also known as 1-Pyrenebutyric acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, PBSE, PBASE, PANHS) is an aromatic molecule commonly used for tethering biomolecules to the carbon rings of graphene and carbon nanotubes. The use of this bifunctional molecule for noncovalent functionalisation of proteins onto a carbon nanotube was first reported by Chen *et al.* in 2001 @chen2001. Prior to this, only direct interactions between carbon nanotubes and biomolecules had been reported.
