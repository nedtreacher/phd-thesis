### 1-Pyrenebutanoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (PBASE)

1-Pyrenebutanoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (also known as 1-Pyrenebutyric acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, PBSE, etc. etc.) is an aromatic molecule commonly used for tethering biomolecules to the carbon rings of graphene and carbon nanotubes. Chen *et al.* first used
