# Introduction

 The ‘bioelectronic nose’, an electronic transducer modified with elements of the animal olfactory system, has the potential to allow specific detection of vapour-phase volatile compounds at concentrations in the air as low as parts per trillion. Insect odorant receptors (iORs) enable simple invertebrates, such as the vinegar fruit fly *Drosophila melanogaster*, to forage for survival by carefully distinguishing between a huge number of specific volatile compounds.  In the past five years, a range of iORs have been successfully coupled with highly sensitive low-dimensional thin-film transistors (TFTs) for specific detection of fruit-like odors in an aqueous environment. These thin films include random networks of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and monolayer graphene, nanomaterials which are both extremely sensitive due to their high surface-to-volume ratio. In this thesis, my aim was to investigate whether a bioelectronic nose capable of odorant detection in a vapour-phase environment could be constructed by coupling iORs with TFTs in a similar manner.

My aim is to develop a 'bioelectronic nose', a biosensor device which couples sensitive biological recognition elements with an electronic transducer for the detection of vapour phase compounds [@Lee2010; @Dung2018; @Moon2020]. The transducer converts the interaction or interactions between the recognition element and analyte or analytes of interest into a measureable electronic signal. The sensitive biological component used here are *Drosophila melanogaster* insect odorant receptors (iORs), while the electronic transducer element is a carbon nanotube- or graphene-based field effect transistor (CNTFET or GFET). Carbon-based 2D nanomaterials are promising for use in novel biosensors as they are highly sensitive, biocompatible and cheap to fabricate [@Shkodra2021]. I created a purpose-built vapour delivery system apparatus in order to test these devices. Initially, however, iOR-functionalised CNTFETs and GFETs (iOR-FETs) were first tested in the liquid phase to corroborate previous findings within my research group [@Murugathas2019a; @Murugathas2020].
    
There has been a significant amount of work done towards creating bioelectronic noses over the last twenty years. This is largely due to their promisingly high level of sensitivity and specificity in real-time in the gas phase, with the ability to signal the presence of volatile organic compound (VOC) traces at lower concentrations than traditional chemical sensors or the human nose in a timescale of seconds [@Lee2010; @Moon2020; @Terutsuki2020]. The implications of successful development of a portable and robust bioelectronic nose are significant and varied. Applications could be found in high-importance fields such as biosecurity, medicine, environmental protection and food or water safety [@Dung2018; @Arakawa2019; @Yang2017; @Son2017]. It has been demonstrated that it is possible to detect invasive brown marmorated stinkbugs based on their volatile trace [@Moser2020]. A bioelectronic nose could potentially accomplish this task far more cheaply and efficiently than trained sniffer dogs.

As well as a variety of practical applications, development of a bioelectronic nose may give us a greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying insect olfaction, as well as novel understandings of the transducer devices used to register the electronic response to VOCs [@Lee2010]. The transduction mechanism of nanomaterial-based iOR sensors is still unknown, and I hope to shed further light on the biological and electronic processes underpinning this mechanism [@Murugathas2020; @Khadka2019].
