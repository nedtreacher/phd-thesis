# Introduction

## Background

The 'bioelectronic nose', an electronic transducer modified with elements of the animal olfactory system, has the potential to allow specific detection of airborne volatile compounds at concentrations as low as parts per trillion  [@Glatz2011; @Kwon2015; @Dung2018; @Kim2022a]. An ideal transducer platform is the thin-film transistor (TFT) which is particularly portable, simple to use, small and robust [@Kauffman2008; @Khan2020]. The thin films used in these field-effect transistors (FETs) include carbon nanotube networks and graphene, low-dimensional nanomaterials which are both highly sensitive and biocompatible [@Shkodra2021]. The implications of successful development of such a portable and robust bioelectronic nose are significant. Applications could be found in high-importance fields such as biosecurity, medicine, environmental protection and food safety [@Dung2018; @Arakawa2019; @Yang2017; @Son2017]. For example, it has been demonstrated that it is possible to detect invasive brown marmorated stinkbugs based on their volatile trace [@Moser2020]. A bioelectronic nose could potentially accomplish this biosecurity task far more cheaply and efficiently than trained sniffer dogs [@Lee2010; @Moon2020; @Terutsuki2020]. There has been rapid progress in the development of bioelectronic noses using carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNT FETs) and graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) over the past 15-20 years [@Yoon2009; @Lee2010; @Yang2018].

Insect odorant receptors (iORs) enable simple invertebrates, such as the vinegar fruit fly *Drosophila melanogaster*, to distinguish between a huge number of specific volatile compounds [@Hallem2004; @Smart2008; @Wicher2008; @Munch2016; @Bohbot2020]. Within the past five years, a variety of *Drosophila melanogaster* iORs have been successfully coupled with highly sensitive low-dimensional thin-film transistors (TFTs) for specific detection of fruit-like odors in an aqueous environment [@Murugathas2019a; @Murugathas2020]. iORs have also been used for sensitive and selective volatile detection in a lipid bilayer format, but not in a portable bioelectronic nose format [@Yamada2021].  In this thesis, my aim was to investigate whether a bioelectronic nose capable of odorant detection in a vapour-phase environment could be constructed by coupling iORs with TFTs. Alongside practical applications, development of a vapour-phase bioelectronic nose using iORs may give us a greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying insect olfaction [@Lee2010]. The transduction mechanism of nanomaterial-based iOR sensors is still unknown, and I hope to shed further light on the biological and electronic processes underpinning this mechanism [@Murugathas2020; @Khadka2019; @Cheema2021].
