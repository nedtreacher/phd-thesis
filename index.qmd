# Introduction

## Background

The 'bioelectronic nose', an electronic transducer modified with elements of the animal olfactory system, has the potential to allow specific detection of airborne volatile compounds at concentrations as low as parts per trillion [@Glatz2011; @Kwon2015; @Dung2018; @Kim2022a]. An ideal transducer platform is the thin-film transistor (TFT) which is particularly portable, simple to use, small and robust [@Kauffman2008; @Khan2020]. The thin films used in these field-effect transistors (FETs) include carbon nanotube networks and graphene, low-dimensional nanomaterials which are both highly sensitive and biocompatible [@Shkodra2021]. The implications of successful development of such a portable and robust bioelectronic nose are significant. Applications could be found in high-importance fields such as biosecurity, medicine, environmental protection and food safety [@Dung2018; @Arakawa2019; @Yang2017; @Son2017]. For example, it has been demonstrated that it is possible to detect invasive brown marmorated stinkbugs based on their volatile trace [@Moser2020]. A bioelectronic nose could potentially accomplish this biosecurity task far more cheaply and efficiently than trained sniffer dogs [@Lee2010; @Moon2020; @Terutsuki2020]. There has been rapid progress in the development of bioelectronic noses using carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNT FETs) and graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) over the past 15-20 years [@Yoon2009; @Lee2010; @Yang2018].

Insect odorant receptors (iORs) enable simple invertebrates, such as the vinegar fruit fly *Drosophila melanogaster*, to distinguish between a huge number of specific volatile compounds [@Hallem2004; @Smart2008; @Wicher2008; @Munch2016; @Bohbot2020]. Within the past five years, a variety of *Drosophila melanogaster* iORs have been successfully coupled with highly sensitive low-dimensional thin-film transistors (TFTs) for specific detection of fruit-like odors in an aqueous environment [@Murugathas2019a; @Murugathas2020]. iORs have also been used for sensitive and selective volatile detection in a lipid bilayer format, but not in a portable bioelectronic nose format [@Yamada2021]. In this thesis, my aim was to investigate whether a bioelectronic nose capable of odorant detection in a vapour-phase environment could be constructed by coupling iORs with TFTs. Alongside practical applications, development of a vapour-phase bioelectronic nose using iORs may give us a greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying insect olfaction [@Lee2010]. The transduction mechanism of nanomaterial-based iOR sensors is still unknown, and I hope to shed further light on the biological and electronic processes underpinning this mechanism [@Murugathas2020; @Khadka2019; @Cheema2021].

## Thesis Outline

This thesis consists of nine chapters. The first three chapters, including this one, are background chapters introducing the general topics of this thesis. The fourth and fifth chapters are methods chapters, while the next three chapters (sixth, seventh and eight) describe the results obtained. The ninth chapter concludes the thesis and discusses possible next steps for future research.

**Chapter 2** gives a broad description of carbon nanotube and graphene field-effect transistors with a focus on their use in sensing applications. The chapter begins by looking at the general structure and properties of thin-film transistors, where key figures of merit such as transconductance, on-off ratio, gate current and hysteresis are described. Graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) and carbon nanotube network field-effect transistors (CNT FETs) are then discussed in greater detail. These descriptions include the chemical composition of each nanomaterial, their conduction behaviour and their unique sensor properties when integrated into a field-effect transistor as a thin-film.

**Chapter 3** investigates existing odorant receptor-coupled thin-film field-effect transistors in the literature. First, the biological structure of odorant receptors and membrane formats for their protection *in vitro* are discussed. Details are then provided regarding the construction and operation of existing vertebrate odorant receptor TFT biosensors. The structure and function of the insect odorant receptor is then contrasted with the vertebrate odorant receptor, and existing insect odorant receptor TFT biosensors in the literature are discussed. The chapter finishes with a brief discussion of non-specific binding and its role in hindering biosensor activity.

**Chapter 4** describes the fabrication of the CNT FET and GFET transducers used in this thesis and the characterisation techniques used to probe their behaviour. The chapter starts with an introduction to photolithography for thin-film transistor device fabrication. Various techniques are described for random deposition of carbon nanotube networks to act as channels for these thin-film transistors. Characterisation techniques described in this chapter include atomic force microscopy (AFM), fluorescence microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and electrical characterisation with various semiconductor device analysers.

**Chapter 5** presents the results obtained from the use of characterisation techniques on the pristine GFETs and CNT FETs. Various carbon nanotube (CNT) network morphologies are displayed and analysed. The Raman spectra and electrical device parameters of these CNT network morphologies are then discussed, along with electrical parameters from graphene devices. The sensitivity of a dense CNT network morphology device is then verified in the aqueous phase.

**Chapter 6** explores the non-covalent functionalisation of GFETs and CNT FETs with various linker molecules for insect odorant receptor attachment. The linker molecules tested were 1-pyrenebutanoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (PBASE) and 1-pyrenebutyric acid (PBA) with 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC). Pyrene-NTA and pyrene-biotin were also investigated as other possible linker molecules. The quality of various functionalisation approaches was then explored with various fluorescently-tagged linker molecules and biomolecules. In this process, various potential obstacles to successful biosensor functionalisation were identified.

**Chapter 7** maps out progress made towards the creation of an insect odorant receptor functionalised TFT biosensor for use in a vapour-phase environment. Two different approaches are described that gave rise to working aqueous-phase biosensors. The first functionalisation approach, which used PBASE in methanol, led to irreproducible results when biosensing. Possible factors causing the unreliability of this method were then investigated. A second approach was then designed to avoid the malign influence of any identified factors.

**Chapter 8** outlines the development of a vapour delivery system for characterisation of the insect odorant receptor functionalised TFT biosensors in a vapour-phase environment. The vapour delivery system was upgraded from an existing system to include new mass flow controllers, to have greater control of flow through the system, and off the shelf vapour sensors, to collect vapour flow data that could be used for comparison against biosensor activity. The chapter also describes the design and construction of an electronic interface to monitor and control the components of the vapour delivery system, and calibration of the system.

**Chapter 9** details the use of the vapour delivery system for testing the functionalised biosensors in the vapour phase. First, the flow behaviour of volatile organic vapours through the system was validated using onboard reference sensors. The response of a pristine carbon nanotube device to two volatile compounds is then compared to the response of carbon nanotube devices functionalised using the second functionalisation approach discussed in the previous chapter.

**Chapter 10** summarises the conclusions drawn from this work, and proposes various related studies which can be undertaken to continue the work described in this thesis.
