<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Out of a wide range of transducer options available for the creation of compact, portable and highly-integrated biosensors, field-effect transistors are among the most promising. Field-effect transistors (FETs), initially proposed in the 1930s, consist of two conductive electrodes on either side of a semiconducting channel, the ‘source’ and ‘drain’ electrodes, alongside an isolated ‘gate’ electrode which is typically perpendicular to the channel. An applied electric field from the gate electrode capacitively controls channel resistance, giving rise to the label ‘field-effect’. By adjusting gate voltage, the flow of charge carriers between source and drain can be varied over several orders of magnitude. The ability of this simple structure to obtain a large signal response from small changes in channel behaviour means field-effect transistors can be used as high-quality amplifiers for sensor applications <span class="citation" data-cites="Kauffman2008 Petti2016 Tran2016 Shkodra2021 Yao2021">[@Kauffman2008; @Petti2016; @Tran2016; @Shkodra2021; @Yao2021]</span>.</p>
<p>Carbon nanotube network and graphene field-effect transistors (CNT FETs and GFETs) are both examples of a class of field-effect transistors called thin-film transistors (TFTs). Thin-film transistors were first developed in 1962 <span class="citation" data-cites="Weimer1962">[@Weimer1962]</span>, and are closely related to the commonly-used metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET). Unlike MOSFETs, thin-film transistors do not use the substrate as the device channel. Instead, current passes through a semiconducting film on the surface of the device; the films discussed here are graphene and carbon nanotubes, two carbon-based low-dimension nanomaterials. Since thin-film transistors do not require a conductive substrate, they can be fabricated using light, flexible and stretchable substrates, making them significantly more versatile than MOSFETs <span class="citation" data-cites="Kauffman2008 Cao2009 Petti2016 Shkodra2021">[@Kauffman2008; @Cao2009; @Petti2016; @Shkodra2021]</span>. Invisible conductive thin-films such as metal oxides and carbon nanotube networks can also be used to create transparent electronics <span class="citation" data-cites="Cao2009">[@Cao2009]</span>. While the principle of modulating current with a gate electrode is shared by the MOSFET and TFT, the underlying physics behind the transistor behaviour differs between the two. The MOSFET is turned on by the change in carrier behaviour when switching from a depletion to an inversion mode, while this is not the case for a TFT <span class="citation" data-cites="Petti2016">[@Petti2016]</span>. Details of graphene and carbon nanotube TFT switching behaviours can be found in the subsequent sections.</p>

<p>Two basic configurations of the thin-film transistor are the back-gated field-effect transistor and the liquid-gated (or electrolyte-gated) transistor. The relatively simple back-gated configuration, shown in <a href="#fig-gating-schematics">Figure&nbsp;1</a> (a), uses the degenerately doped Si substrate as the gate. The channel is isolated from the gate with a thin SiO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> layer. A liquid-gated device, shown in <a href="#fig-gating-schematics">Figure&nbsp;1</a> (b), is used for sensitive liquid-phase analyte detection. A submerged Ag/AgCl reference electrode is generally used as a top-gate in this configuration. The channel is isolated from the gate by the bulk of an electrolyte solution, which can be restricted to the channel area using a hydrophobic polydimethylsiloxane microchamber or ‘PDMS well’. The electrolyte used is typically the biofriendly phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), but other aqueous salt solutions, polymers and ion-gels have also been used <span class="citation" data-cites="Avouris2007 Shkodra2021 Tran2016 Li2023">[@Avouris2007; @Shkodra2021; @Tran2016; @Li2023]</span>.

<h4 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="liquid-gating-and-debye-length">Liquid-Gating and Debye Length</h4>
<p>Understanding the ionic behaviour of the gate electrolyte used in a liquid-gated device setup gives insight into the gating and sensing behaviour of the setup. When a voltage is applied at the liquid-gate, the charged ions in solution move to form two electric double layers, one at the interface between the electrolyte and gate electrode, and one at the interface between electrolyte and semiconducting channel, as shown in <a href="#fig-Debye-length">Figure&nbsp;2</a>. The gate capacitance is a series combination of the capacitance of each EDL in series with quantum capacitance <span class="math inline">\(C_{Q}\)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Heller2010 Kireev2017 Shkodra2021">[@Heller2010; @Kireev2017; @Shkodra2021]</span>. The Gouy-Chapman-Stern model splits the EDL into two distinct regions, the first being a compact layer of ions, the Stern layer, and the second being a more diffuse layer, the Gouy-Chapman layer <span class="citation" data-cites="Tiwari2022">[@Tiwari2022]</span>. The surface potential of the solid-electrolyte interface exponentially decreases across the diffuse region of the double-layer; the characteristic length of this potential screening is known as Debye length, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_D\)</span>. The typical electrolyte Debye length is on a nanometer scale, therefore the bulk electrolyte acts as an insulator, similar to the SiO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> dielectric in the back-gated configuration. The Stern layer capacitance is inversely proportional to the Debye length, and therefore decreased <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_D\)</span> corresponds to increased gate capacitance <span class="citation" data-cites="Heller2010 Ohno2015 Shkodra2021 Yao2021">[@Heller2010; @Ohno2015; @Shkodra2021; @Yao2021]</span>.</p>

<p>The equation for Debye length <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_D\)</span> in an electrolyte solution is given by <a href="#eq-debye-length">Equation&nbsp;1</a>.</p>
<p><span id="eq-debye-length"><span class="math display">\[
\lambda_D = \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_0\epsilon_rk_bT}{2N_Aq^2I}}
\tag{1}\]</span></span></p>
<p>Here, <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_0\)</span> is vacuum permittivity, <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_r\)</span> is the relative permittivity of the electrolyte, <span class="math inline">\(\k_B\)</span> is the Boltzmann constant, <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is absolute temperature in K, <span class="math inline">\(N_A\)</span> is the Avogadro number, <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is the elementary charge and <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is ionic strength in mmol L<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span>. When temperature is kept constant, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_D\)</span> only depends on the ionic strength of the electrolyte and not on any attributes of the gate electrode or channel <span class="citation" data-cites="Stern2007 Shkodra2021">[@Stern2007; @Shkodra2021]</span>. Successive dilutions of a particular electrolyte will increase the Debye length: for <span class="math inline">\(1 \times\)</span> PBS, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_D\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> 1 nm, for <span class="math inline">\(0.1 \times\)</span> PBS, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_D\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> 2 nm, for <span class="math inline">\(0.01 \times\)</span> PBS <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_D\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> 8 nm and so on. This means gate capacitance is directly dependent on the electrolyte used and its concentration <span class="citation" data-cites="Kireev2017 Shkodra2021">[@Kireev2017; @Shkodra2021]</span>. A <span class="math inline">\(1 \times\)</span> PBS electrolyte gives a gate capacitance several orders of magnitude larger than that of a SiO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> back-gate. A larger capacitance significantly increases the effect of electrostatic gating on the channel current, often described as increased electrostatic coupling between gate and channel. A liquid-gated device with low Debye length will therefore be highly sensitive to electrostatic changes across a small voltage range <span class="citation" data-cites="Heller2010 Ohno2015 Kireev2017 Yao2021">[@Heller2010; @Ohno2015; @Kireev2017; @Yao2021]</span>.</p>
<p>However, a decreased Debye length also has disadvantages for sensing. Electrostatic potentials outside of the electrolyte-channel electrical double layer are effectively screened from the channel. Electrical double layers will also form around charged receptors within the solution. The combined screening effect means signals due to potential changes in charged biomolecules within the bulk electrolyte will have no effect on gating of the channel, and therefore no effect on <span class="math inline">\(I_d\)</span>. Interactions between the analyte and any receptor element must therefore occur within the Debye length, and so a tradeoff exists between channel sensitivity and the size of the sensitive region above the channel. Many medium or large proteins will require a relatively dilute electrolyte for analyte capture to be detected by the channel, which may not reflect the intended environment for biosensor application <span class="citation" data-cites="Stern2007 Piccinini2018 Shkodra2021">[@Stern2007; @Piccinini2018; @Shkodra2021]</span>. Other approaches to increasing Debye length without reducing device sensitivity have therefore also been trialled. One approach involves attaching a layer of polyethylene glycol polymer (PEG) to the channel, limiting the approach of counterions. This increases Debye length at the electrolyte-channel interface while preserving the capacitance of the electrolyte-gate interface, keeping device sensitivity relatively high <span class="citation" data-cites="Gao2016 Filipiak2018 Kesler2020 Albarghouthi2022">[@Gao2016; @Filipiak2018; @Kesler2020; @Albarghouthi2022]</span>.</p>

<p>The linear and saturation regions for a metal oxide thin-film transistor are shown in <a href="#fig-linear-region">Figure&nbsp;3</a>. In this thesis, constant <span class="math inline">\(V_g\)</span> measurements from thin-film transistors were typically taken when <span class="math inline">\(V_{ds}\)</span> was small and the TFT was in the linear operation regime. <a href="#fig-gating-transfer">Figure&nbsp;4</a> (a) and (c) show back-gated transfer characteristics of a thin-film transistor, and <a href="#fig-gating-transfer">Figure&nbsp;4</a> (b) and (d) show liquid-gated TFT transfer characteristics. The back-gated device exhibits unipolar behaviour, where the transistor conducts in only one direction along the <span class="math inline">\(I_d - V_g\)</span> curve, while the liquid-gated device exhibits ambipolar behaviour, where conduction occurs along both directions of the curve. The liquid-gated device is also able to traverse a wide range of currents over a much more limited voltage interval than the back-gated device. A variety of quantitative parameters or figures of merit can be extracted from the transfer characteristics of a thin-film transistor <span class="citation" data-cites="Petti2016">[@Petti2016]</span>. Transconductance and on-off ratio are discussed below, while threshold voltage and subthreshold swing are discussed for the carbon nanotube network case in <a href="#sec-electrical-characterisation-CNT">Section&nbsp;1.4.3</a>.</p>
<p>One of the most important figures of merit which can be extracted from the transfer characteristic curve of a thin-film FET is the on-off current ratio, the ratio of the current through a device when the transistor is gated fully ‘on’, <span class="math inline">\(I_{on}\)</span>, to the current <span class="math inline">\(I_{off}\)</span> when gated fully ‘off’. <span class="citation" data-cites="Kauffman2008 Petti2016 Shkodra2021">[@Kauffman2008;@Petti2016; @Shkodra2021]</span>. Having a low off current is desirable as it corresponds to low power consumption by the transistor <span class="citation" data-cites="Rouhi2010">[@Rouhi2010]</span>. In <a href="#fig-gating-transfer">Figure&nbsp;4</a> (a), there is a clear on regime at large negative voltages and an off regime at large positive voltages. Although the transfer curve never completely flattens in each direction, <span class="math inline">\(I_{on}\)</span> can be reasonably estimated with the highest current obtained, while <span class="math inline">\(I_{off}\)</span> can be estimated from the lowest current reading. In an ambipolar FET, such as that shown in <a href="#fig-gating-transfer">Figure&nbsp;4</a> (b), the off current can be defined as the minimum current during the transfer sweep, where the majority carrier transitions from being holes to electrons or <em>vice versa</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="Petti2016 Zheng2017">[@Petti2016; @Zheng2017]</span>. For the backgated channel shown in <a href="#fig-gating-transfer">Figure&nbsp;4</a> (a), the on-off ratio <span class="math inline">\(I_{on}/I_{off}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> 700, while for the liquid-gated device in <a href="#fig-gating-transfer">Figure&nbsp;4</a> (b), <span class="math inline">\(I_{on}/I_{off} \sim 3000\)</span>. The superior on-off ratio is a significant advantage of the liquid-gated configuration <span class="citation" data-cites="Shkodra2021">[@Shkodra2021]</span>.</p>
<p>In the linear regime, transconductance at a specific gate voltage is given by <span class="math inline">\(g_m = |dI_{d}/dV_g|\)</span>. Transconductance indicates how responsive the device is to electrostatic gating at a given gate voltage. In other words, when <span class="math inline">\(g_m\)</span> is large, small changes in <span class="math inline">\(V_g\)</span> can significantly modulate channel current <span class="math inline">\(I_d\)</span>, which is useful for sensing <span class="citation" data-cites="Heller2009a Ohno2015 Kireev2017">[@Heller2009a; @Ohno2015; @Kireev2017]</span>. Transconductance at a given gate voltage is also proportional to the mobility (movement) of charge carriers in the device channel, and therefore depends on the scattering properties of the material <span class="citation" data-cites="Rouhi2010 Petti2016 Li2023">[@Rouhi2010; @Petti2016; @Li2023]</span>. The transconductance at a specific gate voltage can be found from performing a linear fit in a small region around that voltage on the transfer curve. Linear fits for transconductance at <span class="math inline">\(V_g = 0\)</span> V, the operating voltage used for sensing in this thesis, are shown for a back-gated device in <a href="#fig-gating-transfer">Figure&nbsp;4</a> (a), and a liquid-gated device in <a href="#fig-gating-transfer">Figure&nbsp;4</a> (b). The corresponding transconductance values of <span class="math inline">\(g_m\)</span> = 0.002 µS and <span class="math inline">\(g_m\)</span> = 1 µS respectively. The difference of several orders of magnitude between back-gated and liquid-gated transconductance corresponds to the difference of several orders of magnitude between back and liquid-gated gate capacitance <span class="citation" data-cites="Tran2016 Shkodra2021">[@Tran2016; @Shkodra2021]</span>. The ability to achieve high transconductance at relatively low voltage is important for the creation of low power sensors, which is another advantage of the liquid-gated setup.</p>
<p>Application of higher voltages to the gate in both the liquid-gate and back-gate cases can result in significant leakage currents through the gate. These currents mean that the insulating layer at the gate producing the capacitive effect no longer acts as an insulator, adversely affecting transistor behaviour and contributing to sensor drift that may be mistaken for signal responses to analyte <span class="citation" data-cites="Noyce2019 Shkodra2021 Albarghouthi2022">[@Noyce2019; @Shkodra2021; @Albarghouthi2022]</span>. In the case of back-gated devices, gate leakage occurs due to conduction through the oxide dielectric. If the gate voltage produces an electric field exceeding the dielectric strength of the oxide, dielectric breakdown can occur, where the oxide layer no longer acts as an insulator. Breakdown results from voltage-induced oxygen vacancies in the SiO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> lattice forming a conductive path through the insulator <span class="citation" data-cites="Padovani2017">[@Padovani2017]</span>. Irreversible breakdown occured at <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> 50 V for the back-gated channel in <a href="#fig-gating-transfer">Figure&nbsp;4</a>. In the liquid-gated case, the electrolyte used determines the appropriate voltage range for electrical characterisation, since excessive voltages will induce redox reactions. For water-based electrolytes, gate voltages must be kept within the <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 1 V range <span class="citation" data-cites="Wang2010 Ohno2015 Shkodra2021">[@Wang2010; @Ohno2015; @Shkodra2021]</span>. In normal operation, gate current should appear negligible on a linear scale, as shown in <a href="#fig-gating-hysteresis">Figure&nbsp;5</a>.</p>

<p>Thin-film transistor devices typically exhibit some degree of hysteresis, where the history of channel current affects future current behaviour. Hysteresis in carbon nanotube and graphene field-effect transistors is a result of filling or emptying of slow-discharge charge traps in the channel environment. These charge traps effectively dope the SiO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> insulator or the insulator-channel interface, which results from gate bias stress or dopant adsorption <span class="citation" data-cites="McEuen2002 Kim2003 Wang2010 Bartolomeo2011 Bargaoui2018 Peng2018">[@McEuen2002; @Kim2003; @Wang2010; @Bartolomeo2011; @Bargaoui2018; @Peng2018]</span>. A capacitive gating effect from charged ions also contributes to hysteresis, from the use of a electrolyte-gated environment or from charged surface contamination <span class="citation" data-cites="Wang2010 Yao2021">[@Wang2010; @Yao2021]</span>. Due to hysteresis, sweeping <span class="math inline">\(V_g\)</span> forwards across a set voltage range will result in a different <span class="math inline">\(I_d - V_g\)</span> characteristic curve than subsequently sweeping over <span class="math inline">\(V_g\)</span> in the reverse direction. Hysteresis depends on the voltage range used for characterisation, the sweep rate and the environment of the transistor channel <span class="citation" data-cites="Kim2003 Wang2010">[@Kim2003; @Wang2010]</span>. The effect of hysteresis on <span class="math inline">\(I_d\)</span> when sweeping gate voltage is shown in <a href="#fig-gating-hysteresis">Figure&nbsp;5</a>. The measured hysteresis is significantly lower in the liquid-gated case, possibly due to the smaller voltage range. However, this change may also result from a reduction in trap states in the SiO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> layer due to the use of a liquid-gate.</p>
<p>Memory effects are also present during current measurement when both source-drain and source-gate voltages are kept constant. These changes appear as a slow change in current, and are referred to here as either signal drift or baseline drift. In more extreme cases, baseline drift can obscure or even be confused with current changes attributable to analyte interaction during real-time sensing <span class="citation" data-cites="Noyce2019">[@Noyce2019]</span>. Signal drift occurs both in ambient conditions and in a vacuum environment, and cannot be accounted for by changes in room temperature and ambient lighting alone. While research into signal drift is ongoing, it appears to be a hysteretic effect resulting from changes in trap states over time <span class="citation" data-cites="Lin2006 Bargaoui2018 Noyce2019">[@Lin2006; @Bargaoui2018; @Noyce2019]</span>. The high demand for characterisation equipment in a standard device laboratory means that waiting over three hours for baseline drift to settle is impractical, and furthermore, extended periods of voltage application may degrade bio-functionalised devices <span class="citation" data-cites="Noyce2019">[@Noyce2019]</span>. Since trap states are unavoidable to some extent <span class="citation" data-cites="DiMaria1993 Collins2000">[@DiMaria1993; @Collins2000]</span>, data analysis that accounts for baseline drift was therefore explored in some detail in this thesis.</p>

This effect is due to doping of graphene by charge transfer from the metal contacts. In shorter length channels, metal doping affects the entire channel length.

However, for longer channels, metal doping no longer occurs across the entire channel length <span class="citation" data-cites="Bartolomeo2011 Peng2018">[@Bartolomeo2011; @Peng2018]</span>.

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-cnt-network-details">Carbon Nanotube Network Transistors</h3>
<p>The first carbon nanotube transistors were created in 1998, and used a single carbon nanotube as the device channel <span class="citation" data-cites="Martel1998 Tans1998 Kauffman2008">[@Martel1998; @Tans1998; @Kauffman2008]</span>. Over the following decade, there was a general move away from the use of a single-tube as the transistor channel towards that of a large-scale network of carbon nanotubes. In these networks, the individual electrical properties of the CNTs are averaged out across the network, reducing device-to-device variation. Furthermore, the large area of coverage ensures high channel mobility and is preferable in sensing applications <span class="citation" data-cites="Hu2004 Cao2009 Murugathas2019 Li2023">[@Hu2004; @Cao2009; @Murugathas2019; @Li2023]</span>. The carbon nanotube network used for the channel can either be directionally-aligned or randomly deposited <span class="citation" data-cites="Cao2009 Shkodra2021">[@Cao2009; @Shkodra2021]</span>; in this thesis, randomly deposited networks were fabricated using facile solution-deposition methods <span class="citation" data-cites="Zheng2017 Cassie2023">[@Zheng2017; @Cassie2023]</span>. Important attributes of a carbon nanotube film include the density of the network (number of nanotubes per unit area), the ratio of metallic to semiconducting nanotubes present, and the distribution of nanotube diameters present <span class="citation" data-cites="Cao2009 Shkodra2021">[@Cao2009; @Shkodra2021]</span>. The strong van der Waals forces between carbon nanotubes lead to them bundling together within a network. These bundles may contain many nanotubes of different size and chirality <span class="citation" data-cites="Fuhrer2000 Hu2004 Cao2009 Murugathas2019">[@Fuhrer2000; @Hu2004; @Cao2009; @Murugathas2019]</span>.</p>
<p>The band bending which occurs at the interface between the metal electrodes of the device and the semiconducting carbon nanotubes is primarily responsible for CNT FET switching behaviour <span class="citation" data-cites="Avouris2007 Bargaoui2018">[@Avouris2007; @Bargaoui2018]</span>. The Fermi level difference between materials leads to free electrons flowing across each interface until the Fermi levels equilibrate and a electric dipole layer forms. The net electric field created at each interface creates a space charge region in the channel, forming a Schottky barrier which prevents the further flow of a particular type of charge at each interface. The nature of the band bending and resulting Schottky barrier depends on the work function of the metal <span class="citation" data-cites="Cowley1999 Kauffman2008 Zhang2012">[@Cowley1999; @Kauffman2008; @Zhang2012]</span>. A high work function metal bends the valence band of the semiconductor towards the Fermi level of the metal, creating a low barrier for holes but a high barrier for electrons <span class="citation" data-cites="Avouris2007 Zhang2012 Bargaoui2018">[@Avouris2007; @Zhang2012; @Bargaoui2018]</span>. Channel current results primarily from quantum tunnelling through Schottky barriers. The Schottky barriers at the metal electrodes result in one type of charge dominating flow, referred to as unipolar behaviour. However, if the barrier size is low for both holes and electrons, they can flow simultaneously through the channel, which is referred to as ambipolar behaviour <span class="citation" data-cites="Avouris2007 Heller2008">[@Avouris2007; @Heller2008]</span>.</p>
<p>The behaviour of carbon nanotube network transistors is also influenced by a variety of potential barriers existing at junctions between carbon nanotubes. A prominent example is the Schottky barriers existing at junctions between metallic and semiconducting nanotubes (m-s junctions) <span class="citation" data-cites="Fuhrer2000 Topinka2009 Murugathas2019">[@Fuhrer2000; @Topinka2009; @Murugathas2019]</span>. These potential barriers cause increased resistance at these junctions relative to other points in the network <span class="citation" data-cites="Fuhrer2000 Jang2015">[@Fuhrer2000; @Jang2015]</span>. When the channel length is much larger than that of individual nanotubes, channel current must pass through junctions placed along percolation pathways. If only one pathway exists across a sparse network, the network density is at the ‘percolation threshold’. If a network is below the percolation threshold, the channel cannot conduct <span class="citation" data-cites="Hu2004 Topinka2009 Jang2015">[@Hu2004; @Topinka2009; @Jang2015]</span>. When a network with density well above percolation contains a low proportion of semiconducting nanotubes, percolating pathways which only contain metallic nanotubes exist. A device with this film will be highly conductive but cannot be gated <span class="citation" data-cites="Fuhrer2000 Topinka2009">[@Fuhrer2000; @Topinka2009]</span>. Fixing the density but increasing the proportion of s-CNTs means m-s junctions become more prevalent. The introduced Schottky barriers cause a dramatic drop in conductance. As the proportion of s-CNTs approaches 100%, semiconducting pathways with no metallic junctions emerge, and conductance sharply increases once more <span class="citation" data-cites="Topinka2009">[@Topinka2009]</span>.</p>

<p>Like graphene transistors, mixed-chirality carbon nanotube transistors are naturally ambipolar: they can conduct both electrons and holes. An applied gate voltage <span class="math inline">\(V_g\)</span> alters the Fermi energy of the semiconducting nanotubes, modulating the width of the Schottky barriers present, and therefore changing the amount and type of charge flowing through the channel <span class="citation" data-cites="Nakanishi2002 Kauffman2008 Heller2008">[@Nakanishi2002; @Kauffman2008; @Heller2008]</span>. Diameter and separation of nanotubes both influence the gate capacitance of carbon nanotube networks alongside geometric capacitance <span class="math inline">\(C_{G}\)</span> and quantum capacitance <span class="math inline">\(C_{Q}\)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Rouhi2011a">[@Rouhi2011a]</span>. <span class="math inline">\(I_d\)</span> mainly consists of holes at highly negative gate voltages, and mainly consists of electrons at highly positive voltages. At intermediary voltages, both electrons and holes flow <span class="citation" data-cites="Avouris2007 Yao2021">[@Avouris2007; @Yao2021]</span>. Transistor behaviour can be made unipolar through doping the semiconducting carbon nanotubes or by choosing an electrode metal with a particularly high work function, increasing the Schottky barrier for one type of charge <span class="citation" data-cites="Avouris2007 Kauffman2008 Cao2009 Yao2021">[@Avouris2007; @Kauffman2008; @Cao2009; @Yao2021]</span>. For example, the use of gold electrodes promotes <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-type behaviour over <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-type behaviour due to the work function of the metal; ambient adsorption of oxygen will weakly dope the semiconducting carbon nanotubes and likewise promote <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-type behaviour <span class="citation" data-cites="McEuen2002 Kauffman2008 Cao2009 Shkodra2021">[@McEuen2002; @Kauffman2008; @Cao2009; @Shkodra2021]</span>.</p>
<p>A variety of parameters can be extracted which reflect the morphology of the carbon nanotube network. Partial alignment of a random-network carbon nanotube network maximises the transconductance of a device, as this creates more semiconducting pathways, increasing current while preserving the presence of gateable junctions within the network <span class="citation" data-cites="Cao2009 Rouhi2010 Rouhi2011a Jang2015 Li2023">[@Cao2009; @Rouhi2010; @Rouhi2011a; @Jang2015; @Li2023]</span>. The on-off ratio of a carbon nanotube device is largely decided by the ratio of s-CNTs to m-CNTs. The relative proportion of metallic carbon nanotubes in the network determines the size of <span class="math inline">\(I_{off}\)</span>. Therefore, unlike a graphene device, the off current can be readily reduced by eliminating percolating metallic pathways for increased <span class="math inline">\(I_{on}/I_{off}\)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Hu2004 Kauffman2008 Cao2009 Rouhi2011a">[@Hu2004; @Kauffman2008; @Cao2009; @Rouhi2011a]</span>. In a liquid-gated environment, the gate leakage current of a sparse carbon nanotube transistor can approach <span class="math inline">\(I_d\)</span>, leading to significant device noise. A dense network or a graphene device can therefore give enhanced signal-to-noise ratio during sensing <span class="citation" data-cites="Ohno2015">[@Ohno2015]</span>. Noyce <em>et al.</em> found that fully-on back-gated carbon nanotube devices typically exhibit a <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> 3 hour period of steep signal drift, followed by steady-state current flow. This settling behaviour was both reversible and highly characteristic of a particular channel, and could be modelled using a sum of three exponentials <span class="citation" data-cites="Noyce2019">[@Noyce2019]</span>.</p>

<p>Graphene and carbon nanotube network field-effect transistors are both ideal as the transducer element in sensing applications due to their excellent electrical properties and high sensitivity. These thin-film FETs can be used as sensor platforms in either a back-gated or liquid-gated configuration, where the liquid-gated configuration is used in aqueous sensing applications. A key attribute of the liquid-gated configuration is Debye length, which must be optimised for maximum transistor sensitivity. Important device parameters of the graphene and carbon nanotube network FETs include transconductance, on-off ratio, gate leakage currents, current hysteresis, threshold voltage and sub-threshold slope. The voltage corresponding to the Dirac point (or points) of graphene is another important figure of merit for graphene field-effect transistors. Various attributes of the morphology of graphene and carbon nanotube networks contribute to the unique electrical and sensing properties exhibited by these transistors, including graphene folds and junctions between nanotubes of different chirality. The use of these transducers in past odorant receptor biosensor applications is discussed in <strong>?@sec-iOR-sensors</strong>, while fabrication of the transducers used here is detailed in <strong>?@sec-fabrication</strong>.</p>
