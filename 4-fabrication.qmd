# Fabrication of Carbon Nanotube Network and Graphene Field-Effect Transistors {#sec-fabrication}

This chapter discusses the fabrication processes for both the carbon nanotube network and graphene transistors. Experimental optimisation of the transducer element is critical for biosensor work, and large numbers of transducers were required for testing various biosensor functionalisation processes. Therefore, these processes were developed to rapidly fabricate devices with reproducible device characteristics appropriate for biosensing work. Also outlined in this chapter are the characterisation techniques taken to test the quality and reproducibility of these fabrication processes. 

The nitrogen ($\geq$ 99.99%) and oxygen (99.7%) used in fabrication work  was supplied by BOC Limited New Zealand. Deionised (DI) water was taken from a Synergy$^\circledR$ UV Water Purification System. The DI water had a measured conductivity of $(1.4\pm0.1)\textrm{ } \mu \textrm{S cm}^{-1}$, compared to tap water with a measured conductivity of $(7.8\pm0.2)\textrm{ } \mu \textrm{S cm}^{-1}$.

## Deposition of Carbon Nanotubes{#sec-dep-carbon-nanotubes}

4-inch $p$-type (B-doped) silicon wafers with either a 100 nm or 300 nm SiO$_2$ layer (WaferPro LLC) were used as the substrate for carbon nanotube network deposition. A 100 nm SiO$_2$ layer was the preferred option for the devices intended for backgated measurements. Before deposition of carbon nanotubes, the wafers were spin-coated with AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 photoresist, placed photoresist-side down onto a cleanroom wipe, fixed in place using vacuum suction, then cleaved into quarters using a diamond-tipped scribe tool. For fabrication performed before June 2023, the protective photoresist layer was then removed by soaking the quarter-wafers in acetone for 15 minutes, then rinsed with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and dried with N$_2$ gas. However, for complete removal of photoresist, we found it was necessary to flood expose the wafer with the Karl Suss Aligner for 1 min and then place it in AZ326 developer for 3 min, as discussed further in @sec-fluorescence-characterisation. 

Carbon nanotubes were deposited before alignment markers photolithography on all wafers fabricated between Aug 2021-Feb 2023, while devices fabricated before Aug 2021 and after Feb 2023 had alignment markers photolithography performed before the deposition of carbon nanotubes. The process order was first switched in Aug 2021 as this order led to faster processing times. However, the order was switched back in Feb 2023 to minimise the exposure of carbon nanotubes to photolithographic chemical processes.

### Solvent-Based

The solvent-based deposition process for the carbon nanotube network in the second fabrication protocol is as follows. 10 mg of 2-mercaptopyridine (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 1 ml ethanol by sonication until clear. Quarter wafers were sonicated in acetone for 3 min, then exposed to O$_2$ plasma at 100 W for at least 2 min in a small plasma cleaner (Plasma Etch, Inc., PE-50 Compact Benchtop Plasma Cleaning System) or reactive ion etcher (Oxford Instruments, Plasmalab$^\circledR$ 80 Plus) under 300 mTorr pressure. The cleaned SiO$_2$/Si surface was then coated with 2-mercaptopyridine for 10 minutes, rinsed with ethanol to remove residual $2$-mercaptopyridine, and then nitrogen dried. Meanwhile, 5 $\mu$ g of 99% semiconducting carbon nanotube bucky paper (NanoIntegris, IsoNanotubes S-99) was dispersed in 10 mL of anhydrous 1,2-dichlorobenzene (Sigma Aldrich) by ultrasonication until no particles were visible to the naked eye. During this time, the ultrasonic bath temperature was kept between 20 - 30 $^\circ$C or the buckypaper would not disperse successfully. The substrates were then placed into a dish with CNT-DCB suspension and left covered for 1 hour, dipped into ethanol for 10 min to remove residual solvent and any unattached carbon nanotube bundles, and then dried with nitrogen. 

### Surfactant-Based

Two different approaches were used to attach the surfactant-dispersed CNTs. In both approaches, the quarter wafers were rinsed with ultrapure deionised water (DI water), acetone and IPA before being placed into a reactive ion etcher (Oxford Instruments, Plasmalab 80 Plus) and exposed to O$_2$ plasma at 100 W for at least 2 min in a small plasma cleaner (Plasma Etch, Inc, PE-50 Compact Benchtop Plasma Cleaning System) or reactive ion etcher (Oxford Instruments, Plasmalab 80 Plus) under 300 mTorr pressure to make the surface hydrophilic. 1 mL of poly-L-lysine (PLL) was immediately deposited onto each quarter wafer and left for 5 minutes. Then, the quarter wafers were rinsed for 30 s with DI water and dried with N$_2$ gas. This process allows for the surface adhesion of semiconducting single carbon nanotubes suspended in surfactant. 

#### Simple Dropcasting {.unnumbered}

2 mL of IsoNanotubes-S 90% or 99% solution (NanoIntegris) was decanted into a small bottle and sonicated for 5 s to break up bundles of CNTs. An even spread of 400 $\mu$L CNT solution was placed in the centre of the PLL-functionalised quarter wafer, covered and left for 10 minutes. The CNT solution was then rinsed off with DI water and IPA, and then the quarter wafer was dried with N$_2$ gas. Next, the quarter wafer was annealed in a vacuum oven at 150$^\circ$ C for 1 hour. This method would often lead to an inhomogeneous spread of CNTs across the quarter wafer surface, detailed further in section @sec-AFM-characterisation.

#### Steam-Assisted Method {.unnumbered}

:::

2 mL of IsoNanotubes-S 90% or 99% solution (NanoIntegris) was decanted into a small bottle and burst-sonicated once (on then off again) to break up bundles of CNTs. 75 mL of 95$^\circ$ C water was then placed into a glass dish on a hotplate held at 95$^\circ$ C. After this, the PLL-functionalised quarter wafer was placed in the centre of an insulating surface on the same hotplate. The CNT dispersion was carefully spread across the surface of the wafer without spilling any over the wafer edges. The wafer on the insulating surface and glass dish were then left under the same cover for 2 minutes to expose the wafer to steam from the glass dish. The use of an insulating surface meant that the wafer and CNT dispersion were not heated from below while exposed to steam. The steam-assisted deposition setup is shown in @fig-steaming-method.

The CNT dispersion was then rinsed off the wafer with DI water, ethanol, acetone and IPA, and then the quarter wafer was dried with N$_2$ gas. As in the original method, the quarter wafer was then annealed in a vacuum oven at 150$^\circ$ C for 1 hour. This method gave an even spread of CNTs across the quarter wafer surface, leading to a greater consistency in performance between devices. Further details can be found in @sec-AFM-characterisation.

## Photolithography for Carbon Nanotube and Graphene Field-Effect Transistors

![The photolithographic processes used for fabrication of both carbon nanotube and graphene devices (graphene devices were fabricated individually for every step, step #2 skipped for graphene devices)](figures/ch4/photolithography-cycle.png){#fig-qw-photolithography width="90%"}

Photolithography was used to define eight channel regions on each device and subsequently to define metal contacts for each of these channels. A schematic demonstrating these photolithography processes on a quarter wafer is shown in @fig-qw-photolithography. 

Thermal evaporation was used when depositing chromium (Cr-plated tungsten rods,  Kurt J. Lesker) and gold (Au wire, 99.99%, Regal Castings Ltd.), while electron beam evaporation was used when depositing titanium (Ti pieces, 99.99%, Kurt J. Lesker) and metal oxides (*e.g.* Al$_2$O$_3$ pieces, 99.99%, Kurt J. Lesker). Metal and metal oxide deposition was performed using an Angstrom Engineering Nexdep 200 Vacuum Deposition System. Deposition thickness was controlled using an Inficon Deposition Controller and electron beam power was provided by a Telemark TT-6 power supply. For metals, the chamber was initially evacuated to a pressure $5 \times 10^{-6}$ mTorr, while for metal oxides the chamber was initially evacuated to a pressure below $1 \times 10^{-5}$ mTorr. After evaporation, the chamber was cooled and vented with nitrogen.

Carbon nanotube devices were fabricated using the quarter wafer substrates discussed in @sec-dep-carbon-nanotubes. 

Graphene devices were fabricated using 300 nm SiO$_2$/p-type Si substrates covered with a monolayer of mechanically transferred CVD graphene (Advanced Chemical Supplier). This substrate was cleaved into equal-sized square chips before photolithography, with side length between 11.6 - 11.7 mm, subject to variability in wafer size. The same cleaving process outlined in @sec-dep-carbon-nanotubes was used for cleaving the chips, but the photoresist was not rinsed off after cleaving. Devices were exposed to a brief burst of N$_2$ gas to remove any dust from the cleaving process from the surface of devices. When not being used in photolithography, devices were stored in a vacuum desiccator to prevent the quality of the graphene deteriorating with exposure to air over time.

![Damage to graphene (blue region) after DMSO lift-off](figures/ch4/may-21-dmso-damage.png){#fig-graphene-dmso-damage}

Lift-off with dimethyl sulfoxide sometimes led to damage to regions where nanomaterials were present.
:::

 Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was sometimes used in lift-off processes instead of acetone between Jul 2021 and Feb 2023 because of its effectiveness as a photoresist stripping agent. However, it was abandoned due to some indications it was too aggressive for the devices being fabricated, as shown in @fig-dmso-damage and also as detailed in @sec-AFM-characterisation. It is possible that heat from the electrodes deposition sometimes crosslinked residual photoresist on the nanomaterial, and then during lift-off was removed aggressively together with any attached nanomaterial by the DMSO. However, it is also possible that prolonged exposure to DMSO alone was sufficient to detach nanomaterial from the substrate. Therefore, acetone was the preferred agent for lift-off despite being a less efficient stripping agent than DMSO. 
 
 From Jul 2023 onwards, after each photolithography step, quarter wafers/chips were flood exposed to UV light for 1 min and then placed in AZ326 developer for 3 min to ensure complete removal of photoresist residue (discussed in @sec-fluorescence-characterisation).

### Alignment Markers{#sec-align}

Metal alignment markers were deposited in order to accurately align the device channels with device electrodes in subsequent photolithography steps. These alignment markers were asymmetric to indicate the orientation of the device for subsequent photolithography steps and electrical characterisation. In later discussion, channel 1 is defined as the channel placed closest to the large, double square alignment marker. 

For carbon nanotube quarter wafers, alignment markers were deposited either directly before or after carbon nanotube deposition (see @sec-dep-carbon-nanotubes for discussion). For graphene devices, alignment markers were deposited directly after cleaving using the protective photoresist layer spincoated prior to cleaving. AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 was used for alignment marker photolithography. 

For carbon nanotube devices made before Jun 2022, chromium was used as an adhesive layer for gold, while for all graphene devices and carbon nanotube devices made after Jun 2022, titanium was used as the adhesive layer. For chromium/gold depositions, a nominal 10 nm of chromium  was deposited followed by a nominal 100 nm Au layer. For titanium/gold depositions, a nominal 10-20 nm of titanium was deposited followed by a nominal 50 nm Au layer (for independent measurements of metal layer thickness, see @sec-electrodes). Devices were then soaked in acetone for at least 2 hours for photoresist lift-off, washed in IPA and dried with nitrogen. The use of titanium gave rise to a cleaner lift-off and improved gold adhesion. Using a relatively thin gold layer (50 nm nominal instead of 100 nm) proved to still be clearly visible but to a cleaner lift-off.

### Channel Etching

Eight channel features, each 1000 $\mu$m in length and 100 $\mu$m in width with a pitch of 1200 $\mu$m, were patterned using AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 photolithography on each carbon nanotube or graphene-covered substrate. Unwanted nanomaterial not covered with photoresist was then etched away with 200 W oxygen plasma at 600 mTorr using a reactive ion etcher or RIE (Plasmalab$^\circledR$ 80 Plus, Oxford Instruments). The etch time was 3 minutes for carbon nanotube quarter wafers, and 1 minute for graphene chips. The protective photoresist was then removed by soaking in acetone for at least 5 minutes.

Dektat height profiles taken between the source and drain electrodes across a channel from various quarter wafers with electrodes deposited using different approaches. For each quarter wafer, the profiles of three different channels are shown, selected from different locations across the quarter wafer surface.
:::

The source and drain electrodes for each channel were patterned using photolithography with either AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 photoresist (pre-Mar 2023) or AZ$^\circledR$ nLOF 2020 photoresist (post-Mar 2023). As with the alignment markers deposition (see @sec-align), before Jun 2022 chromium was used for the gold adhesive layer, and after Jun 2022 titanium was used. A 20 nm nominal titanium layer instead of 10 nm nominal was found to give better electrode adhesion, and devices after Feb 2023 were made using this thicker adhesion layer.  Good electronic contact could be made with electrodes with a nominal gold layer thickness of 60-100 nm (see @sec-electrical-characterisation), and a Au layer nominally 100 nm thick was most commonly used. 

Example height profiles of chromium layer channels and a titanium layer channels taken using a Veeco Dektat 150 profiler are shown in @fig-dektat-adhesion-layer. AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 photoresist was used here for photolithographic patterning. A 10 nm adhesion layer and 100 nm Au layer were used for both depositions to ensure a consistent comparison. From @fig-dektat-adhesion-layer, we find an measured Cr/Au electrode height of $42\pm1$ nm and an measured Ti/Au electrode height of $48\pm2$ nm, slightly less than half the respective heights stated on the Inficon Deposition Controller.

Although using AZ$^\circledR$ nLOF 2020 photolithography involves more processing steps, it gave rise to more cleanly-defined electrodes with a more consistent height profile. Often electrodes deposition using AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 photoresist would lead to sharp vertical spikes along the edge of the electrode. These edge spikes or "cat ears" could partially or fully protrude through thin encapsulation materials such as SU8 and Al$_2$O$_3$, leading to significant leakage currents from the electrodes into the FET top gate. This effect is due to the profile of positive resists being suboptimal for lift-off processes, as discussed in @sec-photolithography.  

The height profiles corresponding to a wafer with electrodes fabricated using AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 and to a wafer with electrodes fabricated using AZ$^\circledR$ nLOF 2020 are shown in @fig-dektat-photoresist-used. A 20 nm titanium adhesion layer and 100 nm Au layer were used for both depositions to ensure a consistent comparison, resulting in a measured electrode height of $103\pm2$ nm for both wafers. The wafer which used AZ$^\circledR$ nLOF 2020 photoresist clearly has a more consistent electrode height profile across the wafer surface than the wafer which used AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 resist. The measured edge features for the AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 resist electrodes vary in size from 20 nm to 450 nm above the bulk electrode surface, whereas the edge features for the AZ$^\circledR$ nLOF 2020 resist do not exceed 14 nm in height.

### Encapsulation

Several different approaches were used for the encapsulation, or contact protection, of devices. The encapsulation of graphene and carbon-nanotube transistors for biosensing is essential to passivate the electrodes and ensure only the nanomaterial region is active during biosensing, as discussed in @sec-biosensor-methods.

Before encapsulation photolithography the carbon-nanotube network quarter wafers were cleaved into individual 12 mm x 12 mm chips, using the cleaving process outlined in @sec-dep-carbon-nanotubes. Cleaving the devices at this step simplified mask alignment and ensured consistent thickness across photoresist encapsulated devices.
