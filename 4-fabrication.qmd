# Fabrication of Carbon Nanotube Network and Graphene Field-Effect Transistors {#sec-fabrication}

This chapter discusses the fabrication processes for both the carbon nanotube network and graphene transistors. Experimental optimisation of the transducer element is critical for biosensor work, and large numbers of transducers were required for testing various biosensor functionalisation processes. Therefore, these processes were developed to rapidly fabricate devices with reproducible device characteristics appropriate for biosensing work. Also outlined in this chapter are the characterisation techniques taken to test the quality and reproducibility of these fabrication processes. 

## Deposition of Carbon Nanotubes



### Solvent-Based

### Surfactant-Based
