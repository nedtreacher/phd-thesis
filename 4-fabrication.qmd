# Fabrication and Characterisation of Carbon Nanotube Network and Graphene Field-Effect Transistors {#sec-fabrication}

## Introduction

This chapter discusses the fabrication processes for both the carbon nanotube network and graphene field-effect transistors (FETs). Experimental optimisation of the transducer element is critical for biosensor work, and large numbers of transducers were required for testing various biosensor functionalisation processes. Therefore, these processes were developed to rapidly fabricate devices with reproducible device characteristics appropriate for biosensing work. Also outlined in this chapter are the characterisation techniques taken to test the quality and reproducibility of these fabrication processes. 

The nitrogen ($\geq$ 99.99%) and oxygen (99.7%) used in fabrication work  was supplied by BOC Limited New Zealand. All acetone and isopropanol used for wafer/device processing had a minimum 99.9% purity (HPLC grade). Deionised (DI) water was taken from a Synergy$^\circledR$ UV Water Purification System. The DI water had a measured conductivity of $(1.4\pm0.1)\textrm{ } \textrm{µS cm}^{-1}$, compared to tap water with a measured conductivity of $(7.8\pm0.2)\textrm{ } \textrm{µS cm}^{-1}$.

## Photolithography for Carbon Nanotube and Graphene Field-Effect Transistors {#sec-photolithography}

### General Overview

![A side-view comparison of generic photolithography processes for positive and negative resists in the ideal case. Photolithography with a positive resist requires a single softbake step before exposure, while for negative resists a second baking step is required after exposure (Thicknesses shown not to scale).](figures/ch4/positive-negative-photolithography.png){#fig-photolithography-types}

This section details some of the standard photolithography procedures used in the quarter wafer processing detailed in @sec-qw-processing. Photoresists, also referred to here as 'resists', are UV light-sensitive polymeric resins used for photolithography. 'Positive' resists are made soluble in alkalines by UV light exposure, meaning exposed areas are removed in the development process. Conversely, 'negative' resists are cross-linked by exposure and a post-exposure bake step. The unexposed areas of the negative resist are then removed in the development process [@Microchemicals]. Both positive and negative resists are used in this thesis. The processes for each type of resist are shown in @fig-photolithography-types. The specific photoresist selected for photolithography depends on the specific use case. The types used in this thesis are positive and negative AZ$^\circledR$ photoresists (AZ$^\circledR$ 1518, Microchemicals GmbH; AZ$^\circledR$ nLOF 2020, Microchemicals GmbH) and SU8 (SU8-2150, Kayaku Advanced Materials, formerly Microchem). The AZ$^\circledR$ resists used have a minimum film thickness of $1.5\textrm{ } \textrm{µm}$ [@Microchemicals], while the SU8-2150 has a minimum film thickness of $0.5\textrm{ } \textrm{µm}$ [@Kayaku].

![](figures/ch4/overcut-profile.png)

![](figures/(b).png)

![](figures/ch4/undercut-profile.png)

The overcut profile of a positive resist pattern is shown in (a). The undercut profile in (b) is ideal for thin-film metal deposition and subsequent patterned removal, known as "lift-off". Each profile has had the central region of the substrate exposed to UV light prior to development.
:::

Positive resists which have not been thermally crosslinked will soften at higher temperatures ($\gtrsim$ 100°C for AZ$^\circledR$ 1518), leading to a rounded profile. This is not the case for negative resists, which are more thermally stable [@Microchemicals]. Each resist therefore has a different cross-section profile, as shown in @fig-photolithography-profiles. If metal deposition is performed on a positive resist, some metal can collect on the outwardly-sloped sidewalls of the resist which forms significant spikes on the edges of the deposited metal upon lift-off. The outwardly-sloped or 'overcut' resist profile is illustrated in @fig-photolithography-profiles (a). On the other hand, metal cannot collect on top of the inwardly-sloped negative profile sidewalls, which avoids the formation of large edge spikes. The inwardly-sloped or 'undercut' profile is shown in @fig-photolithography-profiles (b). Therefore, the negative resist profile is more suited to metal or metal oxide deposition and lift-off processes, though the process is more sensitive to human error due to requiring more processing steps than positive resist [@Microchemicals]. Finally, when it is suitably processed, SU8 is considered to be more stable and biocompatible than other photoresists [@Albarghouthi2022]. It is especially biocompatible when chemically modified via processes such as isopropanol sonication and O$_2$ plasma treatment [@Chen2021]. 

All photolithographic exposure was performed using a Karl Suss MJB3 Contact Aligner with a USHIO super-high pressure 350 W mercury lamp (USH-350DS, Japan). When performing photolithography, the intensity reading from the aligner was $20.8-24.2$ mW/cm$^2$ (Note however that an external photometer reading at 400 nm found an intensity output of 17.2 mW/cm$^2$ when the aligner read 21.0 mW/cm$^2$). In general, photolithography procedures should be performed under yellow lighting, as light wavelengths from $320-450$ nm can promote reactions in the photoresist used and lead to a decline in photolithography quality. Aging of photoresist over time can also significantly affect the photolithography process, and therefore all processes should be re-optimised regularly over time to give the desired result [@Microchemicals]. The range in processing times for some steps of the processes used here are largely due to the effects of aging on the photoresist. The step-by-step processes for each resist are detailed in the subsequent sections.

### AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 photoresist

1. Spincoat at a final speed of 4000 rotations per minute (rpm) for 1 minute, with an initial acceleration of 500 rpm/s (notes: clean the substrate with acetone, isopropanol (IPA) and nitrogen before spincoating; use only the minimum amount of photoresist required to fully cover the wafer surface; avoid any gaps or bubbles in the photoresist).

2. Softbake $2-4$ minutes at 95°C on the hotplate (2 min for individual devices, 4 min for a quarter wafer)

3. Mask expose for $10-12$ s (note: clean mask with acetone/IPA and N$_2$ dry before use)

4. Develop with 3 parts AZ$^\circledR$ 326 (2.38 % tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) metal-ion free developer, Microchemicals GmbH) in 1 part deionised (DI) water for $30-45$ s (note: rinse for $10-15$ s in one development solution, then perform the rest of the development in clean developer for a cleaner profile; lightly agitate the solution throughout the development process)

5. Rinse device for 30 s in DI water to remove excess developer, then dry under nitrogen

### AZ$^\circledR$ nLOF 2020 photoresist

1. Spincoat at final speed of 3000 rotations per minute (rpm) for 1 minute, with an initial acceleration of 500 rpm/s (notes: clean the substrate with acetone, isopropanol (IPA) and nitrogen before spincoating; avoid any gaps or bubbles in the photoresist)

2. Softbake for precisely 60 s at 110°C on the hotplate

3. Mask expose for $2.7-3$ s (note: clean mask with acetone/IPA and N$_2$ dry before use)

4. Post-exposure bake for precisely 60 s at 110°C on the hotplate to cross-link exposed resist

5. Develop with 3 parts AZ$^\circledR$ 326 in 1 part DI water for $60-70$ s (note: rinse for 30 s in one development solution, then perform the rest of the development in clean developer for a cleaner profile; lightly agitate the solution throughout the development process)

6. Rinse device for 30 s in DI water to remove excess developer, then dry under nitrogen

### SU8-2150 photoresist

1. SU8 was diluted in cyclopentanone until viscosity was low enough to spincoat on substrate and then sonicated at $50^\circ$C for $3-4$ hours (Note: The dilution ratio used was $\sim$ 1 part SU8 to 5 parts cyclopentanone. However, the age of the SU8 may mean that significant evaporation had occurred prior to use, and the amount of SU8 actually present is underrepresented by this ratio)

2. Spincoat first with a final speed of 500 rpm (acceleration 500 rpm/s) for 10 seconds, followed by spincoating at 4000 rpm (acceleration 7500 rpm/s) for 40 s.

3. Softbake for 10 minutes at 95°C on the hotplate
    
4. Mask expose for $6-8$ s (note: clean mask with acetone/IPA and N$_2$ dry before use)

5. Post-exposure bake for 10 minutes at 95°C on the hotplate to cross-link exposed resist

6. Develop with SU8 developer (Kayaku Advanced Materials, formerly Microchem) for $10-15$ s, then clean in IPA for 30 s, repeat this step once then dry under nitrogen (note: lightly agitate the solution throughout the development process)

## Fabrication of Carbon Nanotube and Graphene Field-Effect Transistors {#sec-qw-processing}

### Overview

![The photolithographic processes used for fabrication of both carbon nanotube and graphene devices (graphene devices were fabricated individually for every step. Step 2 is passed over for graphene devices).](figures/ch4/photolithography-cycle.png){#fig-qw-photolithography width="90%"}

Photolithography was used to define eight channel regions on each device and subsequently to define metal contacts for each of these channels. A schematic demonstrating these photolithography processes on a quarter wafer is shown in @fig-qw-photolithography. Masks for photolithography were designed in-house using LayoutEditor CAD software and patterned externally with a UV laser writer. Thermal evaporation was used when depositing Cr (chromium-plated tungsten rods,  Kurt J. Lesker) and Au (gold wire, 99.99%, Regal Castings Ltd.), while electron beam evaporation was used when depositing Ti (Ti pieces, 99.99%, Kurt J. Lesker) and metal oxides (*e.g.* Al$_2$O$_3$ pieces, 99.99%, Kurt J. Lesker). Metal and metal oxide deposition was performed using an Angstrom Engineering Nexdep 200 Vacuum Deposition System. Deposition thickness was monitored by a Inficon quartz piezoelectric sensor and controlled using an Inficon Deposition Controller. Electron beam power was provided by a Telemark TT-6 power supply. For metals, the chamber was initially evacuated to a pressure $5 \times 10^{-6}$ mTorr, while for metal oxides the chamber was initially evacuated to a pressure of $1 \times 10^{-5}$ mTorr. After evaporation, the chamber was cooled and vented with nitrogen.

Carbon nanotube network field-effect transistors were fabricated using 4-inch $p$-type (B-doped) Si wafers with either a 100 nm or 300 nm SiO$_2$ layer (WaferPro LLC) as the substrate. Devices intended for backgated measurements were fabricated with a 100 nm SiO$_2$ layer. Before photolithographic processing, the wafers were spin-coated with AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 photoresist, placed photoresist-side down onto a cleanroom wipe, fixed in place using vacuum suction, then cleaved into quarters using a diamond-tipped scribe tool. For fabrication performed before Jun 2023, the protective photoresist layer was then removed by soaking the quarter-wafers in acetone for 15 minutes, then rinsed with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and dried with N$_2$ gas. However, for complete removal of photoresist, it was necessary to flood expose the wafer with the Karl Suss Aligner for 1 min and then place it in AZ$^\circledR$ 326 developer for 3 min, as discussed further in @sec-photoresist-contamination. 

Graphene field-effect transistors were fabricated using 300 nm SiO$_2$/$p$-type Si substrates covered with a monolayer of mechanically transferred CVD graphene (Advanced Chemical Supplier). This substrate was cleaved into equal-sized square chips before photolithography, with side length between $11.6-11.7$ mm, subject to variability in wafer size. The same cleaving process outlined in @sec-dep-carbon-nanotubes was used for cleaving the chips, but the photoresist was not rinsed off after cleaving. Devices were exposed to a brief burst of N$_2$ gas to remove any dust from the cleaving process from the surface of devices. When not being used in photolithography, graphene-based devices were stored in a vacuum desiccator to prevent the quality of the graphene deteriorating with exposure to air over time. The limited adhesion of graphene to the wafer meant that photolithographic processing had to be performed particularly carefully when fabricating graphene devices.

 A finished quarter-wafer with the unusable edges cleaved off is shown in (a). Note the double alignment markers feature in the bottom left corner of each device in (a), indicating channel 1 'CH1'. The component parts of the field-effect transistor are labelled on device cross-section and channel top view schematics in (b).
:::
 
From Jul 2023 onwards, after each photolithography step using negative resist, quarter wafers/chips were placed in AZ$^\circledR$ 326 or SU8 developer (depending on the type of resist) for 3 min to ensure complete removal of photoresist residue. For each step with positive resist, the same procedure was performed but with a flood exposure with UV light for 1 min before being placed in developer. The exception to this rule was for devices with an Al$_2$O$_3$ layer present. Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH), the active ingredient of AZ$^\circledR$ 326, etches through Al$_2$O$_3$ and causes electrical shorts through the dielectric layer [@Oh2011; @Ali2021]. A further discussion showing the results of this process is given in @sec-photoresist-contamination. @fig-field-effect-transistor (a) shows a completed quarter-wafer of carbon nanotube field-effect transistors, where partial (unusable) devices at the edges of the wafer have been cleaved off so that only a square of nine devices remains. @fig-field-effect-transistor (b) shows cross-section and top view schematics of the completed device with the component parts labelled.

### Alignment Markers{#sec-align}

Metal alignment markers were deposited in order to accurately align the device channels with device electrodes in subsequent photolithography steps. These alignment markers were asymmetric to indicate the orientation of the device for subsequent photolithography steps and electrical characterisation. In later discussion, channel 1 is defined as the channel placed closest to the large double square alignment marker feature. For carbon nanotube quarter wafers, alignment markers were deposited either directly before or after carbon nanotube deposition (see @sec-dep-carbon-nanotubes for discussion). For graphene devices, alignment markers were deposited directly after cleaving using the protective photoresist layer spincoated prior to cleaving. AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 was used for alignment marker photolithography. 

Adhesion layers are required to stick conductive metals such as Au and Pt to SiO$_2$. Cr and Ti are the most common adhesion metals, but Pd and Ni have also been used successfully [@Guarnieri2014; @Shkodra2021]. For carbon nanotube devices made before Jun 2022, chromium was used as an adhesive layer for Au, while for all graphene devices and carbon nanotube devices made after Jun 2022, Ti was used as the adhesive layer. Metal layer thickness values quoted here are as stated on the Inficon controller. These values are strictly nominal and must be corroborated, which was done here using a Dektat profiler. For chromium/Au depositions, 10 nm of chromium was deposited followed by a 100 nm Au layer. For Ti/Au depositions, $10-20$ nm of Ti was deposited followed by a 50 nm Au layer. Devices were then soaked in acetone for at least 2 hours for photoresist lift-off, washed in IPA and dried with nitrogen. The use of Ti gave rise to a cleaner lift-off and improved Au adhesion. Using a relatively thin Au layer (50 nm nominal instead of 100 nm) also improved lift-off quality. Dektat profiler measurements of combined metal layer thicknesses after lift-off are described in @sec-electrodes.

### Deposition of Carbon Nanotubes{#sec-dep-carbon-nanotubes}

Carbon nanotubes were deposited before the alignment markers photolithography step on all wafers fabricated between Aug 2021 $-$ Feb 2023, while devices fabricated before Aug 2021 and after Feb 2023 had the alignment markers photolithography step performed before the deposition of carbon nanotubes. The process order was first switched in Aug 2021 as this order led to faster processing times. However, the order was switched back in Feb 2023 to minimise the exposure of carbon nanotubes to photolithographic chemical processes. The original, solvent-based deposition process for the carbon nanotube network is as follows. 10 mg of 2-mercaptopyridine (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 1 mL ethanol by sonication until clear. Quarter wafers were sonicated in acetone for 3 min, then exposed to O$_2$ plasma at 100 W for at least 2 min in a small plasma cleaner (Plasma Etch, Inc., PE-50 Compact Benchtop Plasma Cleaning System) or reactive ion etcher (Oxford Instruments, Plasmalab$^\circledR$ 80 Plus) under 300 mTorr pressure. The cleaned SiO$_2$/Si surface was then coated with 2-mercaptopyridine for 10 minutes, rinsed with ethanol to remove residual $2$-mercaptopyridine, and then nitrogen dried. 

Meanwhile, 5 µg of 99% semiconducting carbon nanotube bucky paper (NanoIntegris, IsoNanotubes S-99) was dispersed in 10 mL of anhydrous 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB, Sigma Aldrich) by ultrasonication until no particles were visible to the naked eye. During this time, the ultrasonic bath temperature was kept between 20-30°C or the buckypaper would not disperse successfully. The substrates were then placed into a dish with CNT-DCB suspension and left covered for 1 hour, dipped into ethanol for 10 min to remove residual solvent and any unattached carbon nanotube bundles, and then dried with nitrogen. Devices fabricated using films deposited in this manner are referred to in this thesis as 'solvent-deposited' networks.

#### Surfactant-Based {.unnumbered}

Two different approaches were used to attach the surfactant-dispersed carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to the substrate surface. The first approach was a simple drop-casting method, while the second was performed in the presence of steam ('steam-assisted'). In both approaches, the quarter wafers were first rinsed with ultrapure deionised water (DI water), acetone and IPA. Next, they were placed into a small plasma cleaner (Plasma Etch, Inc, PE-50 Compact Benchtop Plasma Cleaning System) or reactive ion etcher (Oxford Instruments, Plasmalab 80 Plus) and exposed to O$_2$ plasma at 100 W for at least 2 min under 300 mTorr pressure to make the surface hydrophilic. 1 mL of poly-$L$-lysine (PLL) was immediately deposited onto each quarter wafer and left for 5 minutes. The quarter wafers were then rinsed for 30 s with DI water and dried with N$_2$ gas. The presence of the PLL on the plasma cleaned surface strengthens the surface adhesion of semiconducting single carbon nanotubes after the surfactant dispersion has been dropcast onto the substrate.

For carbon nanotube network films deposited in surfactant without steam present, 2 mL of IsoNanotubes-S 90% or 99% dispersion (NanoIntegris) was decanted into a small bottle and sonicated for 5 s to break up bundles of CNTs[^2]. An even spread of 400 µL carbon nanotube dispersion was placed in the centre of the PLL-functionalised quarter wafer, covered with a glass dish and left for 10 minutes. The dispersion was then rinsed off with DI water and IPA, and the quarter wafer was dried with N$_2$ gas. Next, the quarter wafer was annealed in a vacuum oven at 150°C for 1 hour to remove residual surfactant. This method often leads to an inhomogeneous spread of CNTs across the quarter wafer surface, which is demonstrated by the variability in electrical properties of the resulting devices. For further discussion of this variability, see @sec-cnt-devices.

[^2]: The composition of the surfactant used in the dispersion is proprietary to NanoIntegris.

:::

For carbon nanotube network films deposited in surfactant in the presence of steam, 2 mL of IsoNanotubes-S 90% or 99% dispersion (NanoIntegris) was decanted into a small bottle and burst-sonicated once to break up bundles of carbon nanotubes. Subsequently, 75 mL of 95°C water was placed into a glass dish on a hotplate held at 95°C. After this, the PLL-functionalised quarter wafer was placed in the centre of an insulating surface on the same hotplate. The carbon nanotube dispersion was carefully spread across the surface of the wafer without spilling any over the wafer edges. The wafer on the insulating surface and glass dish were then left under the same glass dish for 2 minutes to expose the wafer to steam from the glass dish. The use of an insulating surface meant that the wafer and dispersion were not heated from below while exposed to steam. The steam-assisted deposition setup is shown in @fig-steaming-method, where (a) shows the top and (b) shows the side view of the process.

The carbon nanotube dispersion was then rinsed off the wafer with DI water, ethanol, acetone and IPA, and then the quarter wafer was dried with N$_2$ gas. As in the original method, the quarter wafer was then annealed in a vacuum oven at 150°C for 1 hour to remove residual surfactant. This method gave an even spread of CNTs across the quarter wafer surface, leading to a greater consistency in performance between devices. Further details can be found in @sec-cnt-devices. Devices fabricated using films deposited in this manner are sometimes referred to here as "steam-deposited" or "steam-assisted surfactant-deposited" networks (rather than simply "surfactant-deposited", to avoid confusion with the steam-free method).

### Channel Etching

A graphene channel after the plasma etch step is shown in (a), and (b) shows another graphene channel after the metal electrode deposition and liftoff step.
:::

Eight channel features, each 1000 µm in length and 100 µm in width with a pitch of 1200 µm, were patterned using AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 photolithography on each carbon nanotube or graphene-covered substrate. Unwanted nanomaterial not covered with photoresist was then etched away with 200 W oxygen plasma at 600 mTorr using a reactive ion etcher or RIE (Plasmalab$^\circledR$ 80 Plus, Oxford Instruments). The etch time was 3 minutes for carbon nanotube quarter wafers, and 1 minute for graphene chips. The protective photoresist was then removed by soaking in acetone for at least 5 minutes. The graphene channel feature after etching is shown in @fig-microscope-graphene-channel (a).

### Source and Drain Electrodes {#sec-electrodes}

The source and drain electrodes for each channel were patterned using photolithography with either AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 photoresist (pre-Mar 2023) or AZ$^\circledR$ nLOF 2020 photoresist (post-Mar 2023). Before metal deposition, the developed photoresist pattern was exposed to O$_2$ plasma at 50 W for up to 5 s or at 20 W for $20-25$ s in a PE-50 plasma cleaner (Plasma Etch, Inc.) to remove residual photoresist on the developed regions and ensure a clean lift-off. After metal deposition, wafers/devices were soaked in acetone for at least 2 hours for photoresist lift-off, washed in IPA and dried with nitrogen. A graphene channel feature after electrodes deposition is shown in @fig-microscope-graphene-channel (b). As with the alignment markers deposition (see @sec-align), before Jun 2022 chromium was used for the Au adhesion layer, and after Jun 2022 Ti was used. A 20 nm nominal Ti thickness instead of 10 nm nominal thickness was found to give better electrode adhesion, and devices after Feb 2023 were made using this thicker adhesion layer. Good electronic contact could be made with electrodes with a nominal Au layer thickness of $60-100$ nm, and a Au layer nominally 100 nm thick was most commonly used.

Damage to the Au electrode in the graphene channel region after dimethyl sulfoxide lift-off is shown in (a), while (b) shows damage to a graphene film (blue-green region) after dimethyl sulfoxide lift-off.
:::

Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was sometimes used in electrodes lift-off instead of acetone between Jul 2021 and Feb 2023 because of its effectiveness as a photoresist stripping agent. However, it was abandoned due to some indications it was unsuitable for the devices being fabricated. @fig-dmso-damage (a) shows damage by the DMSO to the Au electrodes, and @fig-dmso-damage (b) shows graphene damaged during the DMSO lift-off. It is possible that heat from the electrodes deposition sometimes crosslinked residual photoresist on the nanomaterial, and then during lift-off was removed together with any attached nanomaterial by the DMSO. However, it is also possible that prolonged exposure to DMSO alone was sufficient to detach nanomaterial from the substrate. Therefore, acetone was the preferred agent for lift-off despite being a less efficient stripping agent than DMSO.

The Dektat height profile measurements for source and drain electrodes taken at different locations on four different quarter wafers are shown here. A 10 nm adhesion layer and 100 nm Au layer were used for the wafers in (a) and (b), with chromium as the adhesion layer for (a) and Ti for (b). A 20 nm Ti adhesion layer and 100 nm Au layer were used for both (c) and (d). AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 photolithography was used in (a)-(c), while AZ$^\circledR$ nLOF2020 was used in (d). S is source electrode, D is drain electrode and C is the channel region. E indicates the edge spikes or 'cat ears'  features.
:::

Example height profiles of quarter wafer channels taken using a Veeco Dektat 150 profiler are shown in @fig-electrodes-dektat. AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 photoresist was used in @fig-electrodes-dektat (a) and @fig-electrodes-dektat (b) for photolithographic patterning. A 10 nm adhesion layer and 100 nm Au layer were used for each quarter wafers to ensure a consistent comparison. From these figures, a Cr/Au electrode height of $42\pm1$ nm and a Ti/Au electrode height of $48\pm2$ nm were measured, slightly less than half the respective heights stated on the Inficon Deposition Controller. Although using AZ$^\circledR$ nLOF 2020 photolithography involves more processing steps, it gave rise to more cleanly-defined electrodes with a more consistent height profile. Often electrode deposition using AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 photoresist would lead to sharp vertical spikes along the edge of the electrode, as seen in @fig-electrodes-dektat (c). These edge spikes or 'cat ears' can partially or fully protrude through thin encapsulation materials such as SU8 and Al$_2$O$_3$, leading to significant leakage currents from the electrodes into the FET top gate. This effect is due to the profile of positive resists being suboptimal for lift-off processes, as discussed in @sec-photolithography.  

The height profile corresponding to a wafer with electrodes fabricated using AZ$^\circledR$ nLOF 2020 is shown in @fig-electrodes-dektat (d). A 20 nm Ti adhesion layer and 100 nm Au layer were used for both  @fig-electrodes-dektat (c) and  @fig-electrodes-dektat (d) to ensure a consistent comparison, resulting in a measured electrode height of $103\pm2$ nm for both wafers. A comparison of these figures indicates that AZ$^\circledR$ nLOF 2020 photoresist has a more consistent electrode height profile across the wafer surface than the wafer which used AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 resist. The measured edge features for the AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 resist electrodes vary in size from 20 nm to 450 nm above the bulk electrode surface, whereas the edge features for the AZ$^\circledR$ nLOF 2020 resist do not exceed 14 nm in height.

### Encapsulation {#sec-encapsulation}

Several different approaches were used for the encapsulation, or contact protection, of devices. The encapsulation of graphene and carbon-nanotube transistors for biosensing is essential to improve transistor characteristics, passivate the electrodes and ensure only the nanomaterial region is active during biosensing, as discussed in @sec-biosensor-methods. Before encapsulation photolithography the carbon-nanotube network quarter wafers were cleaved into individual 11 mm $\times$ 11 mm chips, using the cleaving process outlined in @sec-dep-carbon-nanotubes. Cleaving the devices at this step ensured consistent thickness across photoresist encapsulated devices, giving a less variable photolithographic pattern after UV exposure and development.

:::

Two different photolithography masks were used for encapsulation photolithography in this work, with different exposed areas of active nanomaterial. The first mask was used for devices made before Jan 2023, and was designed to leave a region of 500 µm $\times$ 10 µm unencapsulated for each channel. The second mask was used exclusively after Jan 2023, and was designed to leave a region of 200 µm $\times$ 20 µm unencapsulated for each channel. This change was made to double the area of carbon nanotubes exposed to electrolyte while halving the area of SiO$_2$ dielectric exposed to electrolyte during aqueous sensing. @fig-microscope-encapsulation (a) shows the encapsulation pattern resulting from using the old mask for UV exposure, while the encapsulation pattern resulting from using the new mask is shown in @fig-microscope-encapsulation (b). The Dektat profiles of three different devices encapsulated using the old mask as used in @fig-microscope-encapsulation (a) are shown in @fig-microscope-encapsulation (a) and @fig-microscope-encapsulation (b) for AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 and SU8 resist respectively, while AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 and SU8 profiles encapsulated using the new mask as used in @fig-microscope-encapsulation (b) are shown for in @fig-dektat-encapsulation (c) and @fig-dektat-encapsulation (d) respectively. The profiles corresponding to the mask used after Jan 2023 clearly exhibit greater device-to-device consistency, partly due to the mask requiring a greater level of accuracy when aligning the encapsulation pattern with the electrode channel. The larger feature size also means development time has less of an impact on the quality of the encapsulation opening.

:::

Two types of photoresist were initially trialled for encapsulation of carbon nanotube network devices, AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 and SU8-2150. Both AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 [@Murugathas2018; @Murugathas2019a; @Shkodra2021] and SU8 have been previously used for device encapsulation, with SU8 noted for being particularly stable and biocompatible [@Lee2006; @Chen2021; @Albarghouthi2022]. Once developed, the photoresist pattern was exposed to O$_2$ plasma at 50 W for up to 5 s or at 20 W for $20-25$ s to remove excess photoresist from the encapsulation opening. Devices were then hardbaked at 200$^\circ$C for 1 hour to fully crosslink the encapsulation layer. This crosslinking ensured subsequent device exposure to solvent did not remove the photoresist encapsulation. 

The exposed region clear of AZ $^\circledR$ 1518 resist was $6.8 \pm 0.3$ µm in width when using the old, pre-2023 mask, while the exposed region was $16.6 \pm 0.4$ µm wide when using AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 with the new mask from 2023, as seen in @fig-dektat-encapsulation (a) and @fig-dektat-encapsulation (c). However, the exposed region was reduced for the SU8 encapsulation relative to the AZ$^\circledR$ 1518, with an width of only 3.6 $\pm$ 0.5 µm for the pre-2023 mask, as seen in @fig-dektat-encapsulation (b). Photoresist development using SU8 was significantly more time-sensitive than for the AZ$^\circledR$ 1518. This meant when the development time was increased to create a wider encapsulation opening, it was difficult to avoid removing large areas of photoresist across the entire surface of the encapsulation. This meant using the new mask from 2023 was especially important for maximising the exposed channel region of SU8 devices. @fig-dektat-encapsulation (d) shows that the new mask from 2023 with the SU8 resist gave a significantly improved exposed region width of 13.8 $\pm$ 1.0 µm.

A relatively thin SU8 encapsulation layer could be deposited when compared to the AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 encapsulation profile. @fig-dektat-encapsulation demonstrates that the AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 encapsulation layer had a average height of 1.7 $\pm$ 0.2 µm, while the SU8 encapsulation layer had a average height of 680 $\pm$ 20 nm. The SU8 also had much less significant edge features than the AZ$^\circledR$ 1518, regardless of the profiles of the source and drain electrodes. As noted previously, for both resists the overall profile was more consistent for the new, 2023 mask from device to device than for the old pre-2023 mask. AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 encapsulation was used for all graphene devices fabricated.

#### Dielectric encapsulation {.unnumbered}

Another approach taken was encapsulation of electrode channels with a dielectric metal oxide/ceramic layer. A electron beam deposition process was used to deposit a $100-150$ nm nominal metal oxide layer on devices patterned with the 2023 mask using AZ$^\circledR$ nLOF 2020 photoresist. As in @sec-electrodes, the developed photoresist pattern was exposed to O$_2$ plasma at 50 W for up to 5 s or at 20 W for $20-25$ s in a PE-50 plasma cleaner (Plasma Etch, Inc.) before ceramic deposition. Before May 2023, devices were left in TechniStrip$^\circledR$ MLO 07 (MicroChemicals) for $5-10$ min for lift-off. However, due to concerns over the impact of the constituent chemical DMSO on the nanomaterial region (see @fig-dmso-damage), the lift-off process was altered from May 2023 onwards. After May 2023, devices were soaked in acetone for at least 4 hours and sonicated in clean acetone for $30-60$ s to lift-off the photoresist, then washed in IPA and dried with nitrogen.

:::

The initial attempt at fabricating a dielectric encapsulation layer used SiO$_2$ as the dielectric. However, SiO$_2$ adheres poorly to Au without an metallic adhesive layer present, as shown in @fig-dektat-dielectric-layer (a). Aluminium oxide was chosen as an alternative as it sticks well to bulk electrode materials, is heat and chemical resistant, has a relatively high dielectric constant and is bio-compatible [@Guarnieri2014; @Albarghouthi2022; @Kolodzey2000]. @fig-dektat-dielectric-layer (b) shows the Al$_2$O$_3$ successfully adhered to the electrodes and @fig-dektat-dielectric-layer (a) shows the layer had a clean profile after lift-off. Unfortunately, when Al$_2$O$_3$ layers thicker than $\sim$ 100 nm were deposited, a significant drop in channel mobility occurred after encapsulation which made devices unsuitable for sensing. Meanwhile, devices with encapsulation $\sim$ 100 nm thick had significant gate current leakage through the encapsulation layer when liquid-gated. This leakage was present even when AZ$^\circledR$ nLOF 2020 was used when patterning electrodes to avoid edge spikes (as discussed in @sec-electrodes). Furthermore, Al$_2$O$_3$ should not be subsequently exposed to its etchant TMAH, meaning it was difficult to completely remove residual photoresist from device channels after encapsulation. Alternative approaches to high-dielectric ceramic encapsulation are discussed in @sec-future-work-fabrication.

##	Characterisation of Carbon Nanotube and Graphene Field-Effect Transistors

### Atomic Force Microscopy {#sec-afm-characterisation}

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) in this thesis was performed using a Nanosurf NaioAFM in dynamic force mode (also known as tapping mode, oscillating mode, acoustic AC mode or intermittent-contact mode). An ACLA probe (AppNano) was used with a tip diameter of 12 nm, height of $14-16$ µm and a nominal cantilever spring constant of 58 N/m. All atomic force microscopy was performed with the Nanosurf NaioAFM on a stabilising table under a Faraday cage to minimise mechanical and electromagnetic interference. A 256 $\times$ 256 pixel resolution was typically used. Imaging was performed in air at room temperature. AFM images could not be taken from the small exposed channel region on the encapsulated devices, so were instead taken from an alternate representative region from the same process wafer as the device being tested. Moisture adversely affected the AFM imaging process. Therefore, films functionalised with biological materials were washed with DI water and gently dried with N$_2$ before atomic force microscope images were taken. The open source data analysis software Gwyddion (version 2.59) was used to analyse AFM images. This included levelling the background with the polynomial background removal function, removing scarring and zeroing the z-scale.

### Fluorescence Microscopy {#sec-fluorescence-characterisation}

Fluorescence microscopy was performed using an Olympus BX63 fluorescence microscope controlled using cellSens imaging software. Microscope objectives used were all Olympus UPLSAPO/UPlanSApo, apochromat objectives which compensate for spherical and chromatic aberrations. Objectives had infinite aperture and a field number of 26.5. Filter cubes used included the Olympus FITC filter (excitation wavelength range: $467-498$ nm, emission wavelength range: $513-556$ nm), Texas Red (excitation wavelength range: $542-582$ nm, emission wavelength range: $604-644$ nm) and GFP (excitation wavelength range: $457-487$ nm, emission wavelength range: $502-538$ nm). The ISO sensitivity was kept at the lowest available setting, ISO200. All microscopy was performed in darkness with the screen turned away from the microscope. To ensure photobleaching did not adversely affect imaging, images were taken soon after initial exposure to fluorescence and taking repeated photos of the same region was avoided.

### Raman Spectroscopy {#sec-raman-characterisation}

Raman spectroscopy was performed with a HORIBA Jobin Yvon LabRAM HR800 Raman spectrometer. The wavelength and power used for laser excitation of samples were 514 nm and 1 mW respectively. Spectra were taken with a 1800 line holographic grating with a hole size of 300 µm. An accumulation time of 20 seconds was used when taking spectra. Each spectrum was recorded twice at ten positions within a 40 µm $\times$ 100 µm rectangular region on a carbon nanotube film, with a vertical spacing of 10µm and horizonal spacing of 20 µm between each position. Spectra were collected over two wavenumber ranges at each position, with the first range between 100 cm$^{-1}$ and 650 cm$^{-1}$, and the second between 1300 cm$^{-1}$ and 1650 cm$^{-1}$. Data collected at the final, tenth position was often much noiser than all other measurements taken due to an unclear experimental issue, and this data was therefore discarded.

###	Electrical Characterisation {#sec-electrical-characterisation}

Both liquid-gated and back-gated measurements were taken of carbon nanotube and graphene devices.  All measurement setups used had the same basic configuration, with two source measure units (SMUs) attached to the source and gate. $V_{ds}$ was applied between the source SMU (SMU 1) and the drain SMU (SMU 2), while $V_{g}$ was applied between the gate SMU (SMU 3) and the drain SMU. The drain SMU was held at 0 V or connected to a ground plane. Drain current $I_{d}$ was measured at the drain SMU, and gate leakage current $I_{g}$ was measured at the gate SMU. Voltage from the source and gate SMUs was either kept constant or varied, with only one SMU voltage varied at a time. Three different measurement setups were used for taking these measurements, the Agilent (Keysight/HP) 4156C semiconductor parameter analyser, the Keysight B1500A semiconductor device analyser, and a National Instruments NI-PXIe modular measurement system with a 8 GB PXIe-8821 controller and two NI-4138 source measure units in the system chassis.

![A liquid-gated device schematic showing electrical connections to the three source measure units, SMU 1, SMU 2 and SMU 3.](figures/ch4/liquid-gate-schematic.png){#fig-liquid-gate width=60%"}

Liquid-gated measurements were taken using the configuration shown in @fig-liquid-gate. Ag/AgCl standard electrodes were used as the liquid-gate electrode. The electrode was submerged in 80 µL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) 'well'. The well is a flexible structure or c used to contain the PBS solution. with outer dimensions of 12 mm $\times$ 6 mm $\times$ 6 mm. This PDMS well was sonicated in isopropanol for 10 min and thoroughly N$_2$ dried before use. Microscope images of the PDMS surface before and after this cleaning step are shown in @fig-PDMS-clean (a) and @fig-PDMS-clean (b) respectively. The end of Ag/AgCl standard electrode to be submerged was rinsed in DI water and left to sit in DI water for 15 minutes before each characterisation. When using the Agilent 4156C semiconductor parameter analyser or Keysight B1500A semiconductor device analyser for liquid-gated measurements, a Faraday-caged Rucker and Kolls 666 probe station with micromanipulators was used to contact the devices. When using the National Instruments NI-PXIe system for liquid-gated measurements, a custom-made chip carrier with spring-loaded, pointed-tip, Au-coated pogo pins was used.

Back-gated measurements were taken with a Cu plane placed underneath the Si/SiO$_2$ wafer and connected to SMU 3. The Agilent 4156C Semiconductor Parameter Analyser and Keysight B1500A Semiconductor Device Analyser were used for back-gated measurements of devices within the vapour delivery system device chamber. When the lid of this chamber was tightly sealed, it acted as a Faraday cage for another custom-made chip carrier with spring-loaded Au-coated pogo pins, able to contact four channel electrode pairs at once. The Si back was pressed by the pins against a Cu block, connected to the gate SMU. The design of the chamber chip carrier printed circuit board (PCB) is shown in @fig-device-interface (a). The 0.5 mm through holes connect the PTFE-coated wires, which then connect to the output cable, while the 1.75 mm through holes are for attaching the sleeves of Au-coated pogo pins. These pogo pins contact the device within the chamber. 2 × 2.5 mm solder pads have been placed around the 1.75 mm throughholes for better contact with the pogo pin sleeves. The circuit board was placed within two layers of PTFE casing for mounting and protection from vapour within the chamber. The wired interface is shown in @fig-device-interface (b), where the PTFE block is protecting the encased circuit board. The Faraday-cage Rucker and Kolls probe station was used for all back-gated measurements taken outside the vapour sensing chamber.

Custom programs for National Instruments LabView 2017 were used for measurements from the Agilent 4156C Semiconductor Parameter Analyser and the National Instruments NI-PXIe. Keysight EasyEXPERT software was used for characterisation with the Keysight B1500A Semiconductor Device Analyser. Liquid-gated transfer characteristics of carbon nanotube FETs were measured at V$_{\mathrm{ds}}$ = 100 mV and liquid-gated transfer characteristics of graphene FETs were measured at V$_{\mathrm{ds}}$ = 1 V, where V$_{\mathrm{lg}}$ was swept between -0.5 V and 1 V in both the forward and reverse direction with a step size of either 10 or 20 mV. Backgated transfer characteristics of carbon nanotube FETs were either measured at V$_{\mathrm{ds}}$ = 100 mV or V$_{\mathrm{ds}}$ = 1 V, where V$_{\mathrm{bg}}$ was swept between -5 V and 5 V or -10 V and 10 V in the forward and reverse directions with a step size of 50 mV or 100 mV.

A liquid-gated setup was used for aqueous-phase sensing and a back-gated setup in the vapour delivery system was used for vapour-phase sensing. Sensing measurements were performed with constant source-drain and gate voltages. The gate voltage used was chosen by locating the subthreshold region of the device transfer characteristics and choosing a voltage that fell within this region, usually V$_{\mathrm{g}}$ = 0 V. Using the NI-PXIe with the PXIe-2737 module, eight-channel multiplexed current measurements could be taken in rapid succession. An integration time of 200 or 400 ms was used for sampling with each channel, with the actual sampling rate set by the NI-PXIe. In practice this meant a sampling rate of 1.81 s (for 200 ms integration time) or 3.41 s (for 400 ms integration time) for any given channel. A 200 ms integration time meant the time between samples from successive channels varied between $220 ms-230$ ms, while a 400 ms integration time meant the time between samples was consistently 426 ms. The Keysight equipment used a constant 1 s sampling interval.

#### Aqueous Sensing {.unnumbered}

Before the sensing process, 200 µL of PBS was added to the PDMS well and 100-120 µL of PBS was removed. This initial step was performed to wet the sides of the PDMS well, and check that the attachment of the PDMS well to the device would not unseal when larger volumes of PBS were added during sensing. Before any sensing measurement, a transfer characteristic curve was taken of the liquid-gated device. The initial amount of PBS in the well was 100 µL, unless specified otherwise. 

From Feburary 2022 onwards, the standard sensing addition series comprised a control series and an analyte sensing series. The control series was performed as part of each sensing experiment to test for unwanted responses to PBS and to allow baseline drift to settle. The total control series interval was 1800 s. PBS additions of 20 µL were made at 100 s, 200 s and 300 s, while PBS subtractions of 20 µL were made at 400 s, 500 s and 600 s. Immediately after the control series, a sensing sequence was performed as part of the same continuous measurement set. An initial PBS addition was performed at 2100s, to confirm no changes occurred during the control series that would interfere with sensing. Unless specified otherwise, five analyte additions were then made with a time spacing of 300 s, at 2400 s, 2700 s, 3000 s, 3300 s and 3600 s. The experimental series was set to finish at 4000 s. The exact timings, analyte concentrations and gate voltage used in a given sensing sequence are discussed alongside the relevant experimental results.

#### Vapour Sensing {.unnumbered}

Various vapour exposure procedures were used during sensing measurements. These procedures were performed with the vapour delivery system, and are described in further detail in @sec-vapour-sensing-biosensors and @sec-pristine-characteristics.

## Summary

Several approaches were trialled when depositing a carbon nanotube network for the fabrication of transistor devices, which fall under the general categories of solvent-deposited, surfactant-deposited and surfactant-deposited with steam present. Standard photolithographic methods were used to successfully fabricate carbon nanotube and graphene field effect transistor devices. A range of photolithography types and electrode/encapsulation materials were trialled to find the optimal device composition for sensing. Atomic force microscopy, fluorescence microscopy and a variety of electrical measurements were used to characterise the devices. Pristine device characteristics can be found in @sec-pristine-characteristics, while functionalised device characteristics can be found in @sec-noncovalent-functionalisation and @sec-biosensing-iORs.
