# Fabrication of Carbon Nanotube Network and Graphene Field-Effect Transistors {#sec-fabrication}

This chapter discusses the fabrication processes for both the carbon nanotube network and graphene transistors. Experimental optimisation of the transducer element is critical for biosensor work, and large numbers of transducers were required for testing various biosensor functionalisation processes. Therefore, these processes were developed to rapidly fabricate devices with reproducible device characteristics appropriate for biosensing work. Also outlined in this chapter are the characterisation techniques taken to test the quality and reproducibility of these fabrication processes. 

## Deposition of Carbon Nanotubes

4-inch $p$-type (B-doped) silicon wafers with either a 100 nm or 300 nm SiO$_2$ layer (WaferPro LLC) were used as the substrate for carbon nanotube network deposition. A 100 nm SiO$_2$ layer was the preferred option for the devices intended for backgated measurements.

### Solvent-Based

The solvent-based deposition process for the carbon nanotube network in the second fabrication protocol is as follows. 5 $\mu$g of carbon nanotube bucky paper (NanoIntegris, IsoNanotubes S-99) was dispersed in 10 mL of dichlorobenzene (Sigma Aldrich) by ultrasonication until no particles were visible to the naked eye. The ultrasonic bath temperature was kept constant at 25$^\circ$C. A 10 mg solution of 2-mercaptopyridine (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 1 ml ethanol and drop-cast over the cleaned SiO$_2$/Si surface for 20 minutes, followed by rinsing in ethanol to remove residual $2$-mercaptopyridine and drying with nitrogen. The substrates were then submerged into the CNT-DCB suspension for 2 hours, dipped into ethanol for 10 min to remove excess solvent and any unattached carbon nanotube bundles, and then dried with nitrogen.
