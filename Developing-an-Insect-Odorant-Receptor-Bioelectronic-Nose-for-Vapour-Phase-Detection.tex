The ability to detect volatile organic compounds in a highly sensitive and selective manner is desirable for applications as varied as diagnosis of illnesses at a remote clinic, monitoring of air in an industrial setting, or identification of invasive organisms at a biosecurity checkpoint. Historically, animal noses have been used for such tasks, as their combined sensitivity and selectivity are greatly superior to traditional artificial sensors. However, training and deploying animals in such situations is both time and cost intensive. In recent years, an improved understanding of \textit{in vivo} biological sensing has led to efforts to mimic these highly efficient processes in an artificial sensor format. \\[5pt] To this end, a “bioelectronic nose” was developed. This sensor uses an artificial transducer to amplify responses of an insect olfactory system to specific volatile compounds. Thin-film transistors were used as the amplifier element, given their low cost, small size and extreme sensitivity. Various thin-film morphologies were compared, and their suitability for bioelectronic nose development assessed. Transducers made using a novel steam-assisted thin-film deposition technique were found to have highly consistent device-to-device electrical properties relative to other films. Films made using this process typically showed more surface contamination than other morphologies, but their high sensitivity was nonetheless confirmed with a non-specific sensing series in an aqueous environment. \\[5pt] One of the major challenges encountered in this thesis was variability in the quality of sensor functionalisation. Raman spectroscopy and fluorescence microscopy confirmed an existing non-covalent attachment method could successfully immobilise nanodiscs onto the transistor channel region. However, various sensors functionalised using the same procedure often exhibited no sensing activity. Extensive electrical characterisation indicated the presence of an unidentified contamination layer preventing electrical interaction between the insect odorant receptors and transducer thin-film. It was shown that this layer was unlikely to be directly associated with the thin-film morphology used for the transducer. \\[5pt] Subsequently, an alternative biotin-based non-covalent method which eliminated several possible contamination sources was trialled. This alternative biotin-based method was used to demonstrate successful aqueous sensing of femtomolar concentrations of methyl salicylate by an iOR10a-functionalised device. When tested in a custom-built vapour delivery system, a similar bioelectronic sensor was shown to be highly sensitive to the target vapour. However, consistent reproduction of the biotin-based method was challenging due to the invasive cleaning method involved. It was therefore difficult to determine conclusively whether sensor responses were selective. By finding new, systematic approaches to address the major barriers to sensor success carefully identified in this work, there are promising signs that a highly reliable vapour-phase bioelectronic nose can be produced.

I chose to start my doctoral studies just a few months into a global pandemic. Completing a challenging project with a worldwide crisis in the background might have been impossible without the supervision of AProf. Natalie Plank. Her ability to adapt to and overcome any problem has taught me that there is no situation which is truly unmanageable. I am deeply grateful for her leadership throughout a time of particular chaos. \newpage

I started this project with minimal formal training in biological science, coming from a primarily physics and engineering background. \\[5pt] The immense support I received from Melissa Jordan and Colm Carraher from the Institute for Plant and Food Research (PFR) to complete this project meant that this was not an issue, and I thank them both immensely for this. \\[5pt] I would not have been able to begin this thesis without the financial backing and support I received from PFR and the Better Border Biosecurity (B3) programme. In particular, I am very grateful to Andrew Kralicek, formerly with PFR and now at Scentian Bio, and the ex-Director of B3, David Teulon, for helping to secure funding for my project. I would also like to thank the donor of the Ernest Marsden Scholarship in Physics for their significant financial support. \\[5pt] There are many incredibly supportive people who I worked alongside during my project. I would like to start off by thanking Rifat Ullah, whose mentoring and kindness encouraged me to pursue further study. His work on the initial design and setup of the vapour delivery system was invaluable to me throughout this project. I am also especially grateful to Alex Puglisi, for constructing the mechanical elements of the vapour delivery system and giving me extensive feedback on the system design. I would like to thank Peter Coard, for his advice and guidance when constructing the electrical elements of the vapour delivery system. I would also like to thank Selvan Murugathas for his advice on constructing the insect odorant receptor sensors, as well as Damon Colbert and Valentina Lucarelli, who provided the insect odorant receptor nanodiscs used in this work. \\[5pt] Thank you to AProf. Ben Ruck, my supportive secondary supervisor, and to AProf. Franck Natali, for always asking about my thesis in the tearoom.

The `bioelectronic nose', an electronic transducer modified with
elements of the animal olfactory system, has the potential to allow
specific detection of airborne volatile compounds at concentrations as
low as parts per trillion
\autocite{Glatz2011,Kwon2015,Dung2018,Kim2022a}. An ideal transducer
platform is the thin-film transistor (TFT) which is particularly
portable, simple to use, small and robust
\autocite{Kauffman2008,Khan2020}. The thin films used in these
field-effect transistors (FETs) include carbon nanotube networks and
graphene, low-dimensional nanomaterials which are both highly sensitive
and biocompatible \autocite{Shkodra2021}. The implications of successful
development of such a portable and robust bioelectronic nose are
significant. Applications could be found in high-importance fields such
as biosecurity, medicine, environmental protection and food safety
\autocite{Dung2018,Arakawa2019,Yang2017,Son2017}. For example, it has
been demonstrated that it is possible to detect invasive brown
marmorated stinkbugs based on their volatile trace \autocite{Moser2020}.
A bioelectronic nose could potentially accomplish this biosecurity task
far more cheaply and efficiently than trained sniffer dogs
\autocite{Lee2010,Moon2020,Terutsuki2020}. There has been rapid progress
in the development of bioelectronic noses using carbon nanotube
field-effect transistors (CNT FETs) and graphene field-effect
transistors (GFETs) over the past 15-20 years
\autocite{Yoon2009,Lee2010,Yang2018}.

Insect odorant receptors (iORs) enable simple invertebrates, such as the
vinegar fruit fly \emph{Drosophila melanogaster}, to distinguish between
a huge number of specific volatile compounds
\autocite{Hallem2004,Smart2008,Wicher2008,Munch2016,Bohbot2020}. Within
the past five years, a variety of \emph{Drosophila melanogaster} iORs
have been successfully coupled with highly sensitive low-dimensional
thin-film transistors (TFTs) for specific detection of fruit-like odors
in an aqueous environment \autocite{Murugathas2019a,Murugathas2020}.
iORs have also been used for sensitive and selective volatile detection
in a lipid bilayer format, but not in a portable bioelectronic nose
format \autocite{Yamada2021}. In this thesis, my aim was to investigate
whether a bioelectronic nose capable of odorant detection in a
vapour-phase environment could be constructed by coupling iORs with
TFTs. Alongside practical applications, development of a vapour-phase
bioelectronic nose using iORs may give us a greater understanding of the
mechanisms underlying insect olfaction \autocite{Lee2010}. The
transduction mechanism of nanomaterial-based iOR sensors is still
unknown, and I hope to shed further light on the biological and
electronic processes underpinning this mechanism
\autocite{Murugathas2020,Khadka2019,Cheema2021}.

\section{Thesis Outline}\label{thesis-outline}}

This thesis consists of nine chapters. The first three chapters,
including this one, are background chapters introducing the general
topics of this thesis. The fourth and fifth chapters are methods
chapters, while the next three chapters (sixth, seventh and eight)
describe the results obtained. The ninth chapter concludes the thesis
and discusses possible next steps for future research.

\textbf{Chapter 2} gives a broad description of carbon nanotube and
graphene field-effect transistors with a focus on their use in sensing
applications. The chapter begins by looking at the general structure and
properties of thin-film transistors, where key figures of merit such as
transconductance, on-off ratio, gate current and hysteresis are
described. Graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) and carbon nanotube
network field-effect transistors (CNT FETs) are then discussed in
greater detail. These descriptions include the chemical composition of
each nanomaterial, their conduction behaviour and their unique sensor
properties when integrated into a field-effect transistor as a
thin-film.

\textbf{Chapter 3} investigates existing odorant receptor-coupled
thin-film field-effect transistors in the literature. First, the
biological structure of odorant receptors and membrane formats for their
protection in vitro are discussed. Details are then provided regarding
the construction and operation of existing vertebrate odorant receptor
TFT biosensors. The structure and function of the insect odorant
receptor is then contrasted with the vertebrate odorant receptor, and
existing insect odorant receptor TFT biosensors in the literature are
discussed. The chapter finishes with a brief discussion of non-specific
binding and its role in hindering biosensor activity.

\textbf{Chapter 4} describes the fabrication of the CNT FET and GFET
transducers used in this thesis and the characterisation techniques used
to probe their behaviour. The chapter starts with an introduction to
photolithography for thin-film transistor device fabrication. Various
techniques are described for random deposition of carbon nanotube
networks to act as channels for these thin-film transistors.
Characterisation techniques described in this chapter include atomic
force microscopy (AFM), fluorescence microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and
electrical characterisation with various semiconductor device analysers.

\textbf{Chapter 5} outlines the development of a vapour delivery system
for characterisation of the insect odorant receptor functionalised TFT
biosensors in a vapour-phase environment. The vapour delivery system was
upgraded from an existing system to include new mass flow controllers,
to have greater control of flow through the system, and off the shelf
vapour sensors, to collect vapour flow data that could be used for
comparison against biosensor activity. The chapter also describes the
design and construction of an electronic interface to monitor and
control the components of the vapour delivery system. The flow rate
through the system was then calibrated and reference sensors tested.

\textbf{Chapter 6} presents the results obtained from the use of
characterisation techniques on the pristine GFETs and CNT FETs. Various
carbon nanotube (CNT) network morphologies are displayed and analysed.
The Raman spectra and electrical device parameters of these CNT network
morphologies are then discussed, along with electrical parameters from
graphene devices. The sensitivity of a dense CNT network morphology
device is then tested in both the aqueous and vapour-phase.

\textbf{Chapter 7} explores the non-covalent functionalisation of GFETs
and CNT FETs with various linker molecules for insect odorant receptor
attachment. The linker molecules tested were 1-pyrenebutanoic acid
N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (PBASE) and 1-pyrenebutyric acid (PBA) with
1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC). Pyrene-NTA and
pyrene-biotin were also investigated as other possible linker molecules.
The quality of various functionalisation approaches was then explored
with various fluorescently-tagged linker molecules and biomolecules. In
this process, various potential obstacles to successful biosensor
functionalisation were identified.

\textbf{Chapter 8} details progress made towards the creation of an
insect odorant receptor functionalised TFT biosensor for use in a
vapour-phase environment. Two different approaches are described that
gave rise to working aqueous-phase biosensors. The first
functionalisation approach, which used PBASE in methanol, led to
irreproducible results when biosensing. Possible factors causing the
unreliability of this method were then investigated. A second approach
was then designed to avoid the malign influence of any identified
factors. Biosensors functionalised using this approach were then tested
in a vapour-phase environment.

\textbf{Chapter 9} summarises the conclusions drawn from this work, and
proposes various related studies which can be undertaken to continue the
work described in this thesis.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-1}}

This chapter discusses the fabrication processes for both carbon
nanotube network and graphene thin-film transistors (TFTs). Experimental
optimisation of the transducer element is critical for biosensor work,
and large numbers of transducers were required for testing various
biosensor functionalisation processes. Therefore, these processes were
developed to rapidly fabricate devices with reproducible device
characteristics appropriate for biosensing work. Also outlined in this
chapter are the characterisation techniques taken to test the quality
and reproducibility of these fabrication processes.

The nitrogen (\(\geq\) 99.99\%) and oxygen (99.7\%) used in fabrication
work was supplied by BOC Limited New Zealand. All acetone and
isopropanol used for wafer/device processing had a minimum 99.9\% purity
(HPLC grade). Deionised (DI) water was taken from a
Synergy\(^\circledR\) UV Water Purification System. The DI water had a
measured conductivity of \((1.4\pm0.1)\textrm{ } \textrm{µS cm}^{-1}\),
compared to tap water with a measured conductivity of
\((7.8\pm0.2)\textrm{ } \textrm{µS cm}^{-1}\).

Transistors}\label{sec-photolithography}}

\hypertarget{general-overview}{%
\subsection{General Overview}\label{general-overview}}

This section details some of the standard photolithography procedures
used in the quarter wafer processing detailed in
Section~\ref{sec-qw-processing}. Photoresists, also referred to here as
`resists', are UV light-sensitive polymeric resins used for
photolithography. `Positive' resists are made soluble in alkalines by UV
light exposure, meaning exposed areas are removed in the development
process. Conversely, `negative' resists are cross-linked by exposure and
a post-exposure bake step. The unexposed areas of the negative resist
are then removed in the development process \autocite{Microchemicals1}.
Both positive and negative resists are used in this thesis. The
processes for each type of resist are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-photolithography-profiles} (a). The specific photoresist
selected for photolithography depends on the specific use case. The
types used in this thesis are positive and negative AZ\(^\circledR\)
photoresists (AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518, Microchemicals GmbH;
AZ\(^\circledR\) nLOF 2020, Microchemicals GmbH) and SU8 (SU8-2150,
Kayaku Advanced Materials, formerly Microchem). The AZ\(^\circledR\)
resists used have a minimum film thickness of
\(1.5\textrm{ } \textrm{µm}\) \autocite{Microchemicals1}, while the
SU8-2150 has a minimum film thickness of \(0.5\textrm{ } \textrm{µm}\)
\autocite{Kayaku}.

\caption{\label{fig-photolithography-profiles}A side-view comparison of
generic photolithography processes for positive and negative resists in
the ideal case. Photolithography with a positive resist requires a
single softbake step before exposure, while for negative resists a
second baking step is required after exposure (Thicknesses shown not to
scale). The overcut profile of a positive resist pattern is shown in
(b). The undercut profile in (c) is ideal for thin-film metal deposition
and subsequent patterned removal, known as ``lift-off''. Each profile
has had the central region of the substrate exposed to UV light prior to
development.}

\end{figure}

Positive resists which have not been thermally crosslinked will soften
at higher temperatures (\(\gtrsim\) 100°C for AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518),
leading to a rounded profile. This is not the case for negative resists,
which are more thermally stable \autocite{Microchemicals1}. Each resist
therefore has a different cross-section profile, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-photolithography-profiles} (b) and (c). If metal
deposition is performed on a positive resist, some metal can collect on
the outwardly-sloped sidewalls of the resist which forms significant
spikes on the edges of the deposited metal upon lift-off. The
outwardly-sloped or `overcut' resist profile is illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig-photolithography-profiles} (b). On the other hand, metal
cannot collect on top of the inwardly-sloped negative profile sidewalls,
which avoids the formation of large edge spikes. The inwardly-sloped or
`undercut' profile is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-photolithography-profiles} (c). Therefore, the negative
resist profile is more suited to metal or metal oxide deposition and
lift-off processes, though the process is more sensitive to human error
due to requiring more processing steps than positive resist
\autocite{Microchemicals1}. Finally, when it is suitably processed, SU8
is considered to be more stable and biocompatible than other
photoresists \autocite{Albarghouthi2022}. It is especially biocompatible
when chemically modified via processes such as isopropanol sonication
and O\(_2\) plasma treatment \autocite{Chen2021}.

All photolithographic exposure was performed using a Karl Suss MJB3
Contact Aligner with a USHIO super-high pressure 350 W mercury lamp
(USH-350DS, Japan). When performing photolithography, the intensity
reading from the aligner was \(20.8-24.2\) mW/cm\(^2\) (Note however
that an external photometer reading at 400 nm found an intensity output
of 17.2 mW/cm\(^2\) when the aligner read 21.0 mW/cm\(^2\)). In general,
photolithography procedures should be performed under yellow lighting,
as light wavelengths from \(320-450\) nm can promote reactions in the
photoresist used and lead to a decline in photolithography quality.
Aging of photoresist over time can also significantly affect the
photolithography process, and therefore all processes should be
re-optimised regularly over time to give the desired result
\autocite{Microchemicals1}. The range in processing times for some steps
of the processes used here are largely due to the effects of aging on
the photoresist. The step-by-step processes for each resist are detailed
in the subsequent sections.

used for fabrication of both carbon nanotube and graphene devices. Step
2 was skipped for graphene devices, which were fabricated using
individual 11 mm \(\times\) 11 mm chips.}

\end{figure}

Photolithography was used to define eight channel regions on each device
and subsequently to define metal contacts for each of these channels. A
schematic demonstrating these photolithography processes on a quarter
wafer is shown in Figure~\ref{fig-qw-photolithography}. Masks for
photolithography were designed in-house using LayoutEditor CAD software
and patterned externally with a UV laser writer. Thermal evaporation was
used when depositing Cr (chromium-plated tungsten rods, Kurt J. Lesker)
and Au (gold wire, 99.99\%, Regal Castings Ltd.), while electron beam
evaporation was used when depositing Ti (Ti pieces, 99.99\%, Kurt J.
Lesker) and metal oxides (\emph{e.g.} Al\(_2\)O\(_3\) pieces, 99.99\%,
Kurt J. Lesker). Metal and metal oxide deposition was performed using an
Angstrom Engineering Nexdep 200 Vacuum Deposition System. Deposition
thickness was monitored by a Inficon quartz piezoelectric sensor and
controlled using an Inficon Deposition Controller. Electron beam power
was provided by a Telemark TT-6 power supply. For metals, the chamber
was initially evacuated to a pressure \(5 \times 10^{-6}\) mTorr, while
for metal oxides the chamber was initially evacuated to a pressure of
\(1 \times 10^{-5}\) mTorr. After evaporation, the chamber was cooled
and vented with nitrogen.

Carbon nanotube network field-effect transistors were fabricated using
4-inch \(p\)-type (B-doped) Si wafers with either a 100 nm or 300 nm
SiO\(_2\) layer (WaferPro LLC) as the substrate. Devices intended for
backgated measurements were fabricated with a 100 nm SiO\(_2\) layer.
Before photolithographic processing, the wafers were spin-coated with
AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518 photoresist, placed photoresist-side down onto a
cleanroom wipe, fixed in place using vacuum suction, then cleaved into
quarters using a diamond-tipped scribe tool. For fabrication performed
before Jun 2023, the protective photoresist layer was then removed by
soaking the quarter-wafers in acetone for 15 minutes, then rinsed with
isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and dried with N\(_2\) gas. However, for
complete removal of photoresist, it was necessary to flood expose the
wafer with the Karl Suss Aligner for 1 min and then place it in
AZ\(^\circledR\) 326 developer for 3 min, as discussed further in
\textbf{?@sec-photoresist-contamination}.

Graphene field-effect transistors were fabricated using 300 nm
SiO\(_2\)/\(p\)-type Si substrates covered with a monolayer of
mechanically transferred CVD graphene (Advanced Chemical Supplier). This
substrate was cleaved into equal-sized square chips before
photolithography, with side length between \(11.6-11.7\) mm, subject to
variability in wafer size. The same cleaving process outlined in
Section~\ref{sec-dep-carbon-nanotubes} was used for cleaving the chips,
but the photoresist was not rinsed off after cleaving. Devices were
exposed to a brief burst of N\(_2\) gas to remove any dust from the
surface of devices resulting from the cleaving process. When not being
used in photolithography, graphene-based devices were stored in a vacuum
desiccator to prevent the quality of the graphene deteriorating with
exposure to air over time. The limited adhesion of graphene to the wafer
meant that photolithographic processing had to be performed particularly
carefully when fabricating graphene devices.

\end{figure}

From Jul 2023 onwards, after each photolithography step using negative
resist, quarter wafers/chips were placed in AZ\(^\circledR\) 326 or SU8
developer (depending on the type of resist) for 3 min to ensure complete
removal of photoresist residue. For each step with positive resist, the
same procedure was performed but with a flood exposure with UV light for
1 min before being placed in developer. The exception to this rule was
for devices with an Al\(_2\)O\(_3\) layer present. Tetramethylammonium
hydroxide (TMAH), the active ingredient of AZ\(^\circledR\) 326, etches
through Al\(_2\)O\(_3\) and causes electrical shorts through the
dielectric layer \autocite{Oh2011,Ali2021}. A further discussion showing
the results of this process is given in
\textbf{?@sec-photoresist-contamination}.
Figure~\ref{fig-field-effect-transistor} (a) shows a completed
quarter-wafer of carbon nanotube field-effect transistors, where partial
(unusable) devices at the edges of the wafer have been cleaved off so
that only a square of nine devices remains.
Figure~\ref{fig-field-effect-transistor} (b) shows cross-section and top
view schematics of the completed device with the component parts
labelled.

\hypertarget{sec-align}{%
\subsection{Alignment Markers}\label{sec-align}}

Metal alignment markers were deposited in order to accurately align the
device channels with device electrodes in subsequent photolithography
steps. These alignment markers were asymmetric to indicate the
orientation of the device for subsequent photolithography steps and
electrical characterisation. In later discussion, channel 1 is defined
as the channel placed closest to the large double square alignment
marker feature. For carbon nanotube quarter wafers, alignment markers
were deposited either directly before or after carbon nanotube
deposition (see Section~\ref{sec-dep-carbon-nanotubes} for discussion).
For graphene devices, alignment markers were deposited directly after
cleaving using the protective photoresist layer spincoated prior to
cleaving. AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518 was used for alignment marker
photolithography.

Adhesion layers are required to stick conductive metals such as Au and
Pt to SiO\(_2\). Cr and Ti are the most common adhesion metals, but Pd
and Ni have also been used successfully
\autocite{Guarnieri2014,Shkodra2021}. For carbon nanotube devices made
before Jun 2022, chromium was used as an adhesive layer for Au, while
for all graphene devices and carbon nanotube devices made after Jun
2022, Ti was used as the adhesive layer. Metal layer thickness values
quoted here are as stated on the Inficon controller. These values are
strictly nominal and must be corroborated, which was done here using a
Dektat profiler. For chromium/Au depositions, 10 nm of chromium was
deposited followed by a 100 nm Au layer. For Ti/Au depositions,
\(10-20\) nm of Ti was deposited followed by a 50 nm Au layer. Devices
were then soaked in acetone for at least 2 hours for photoresist
lift-off, washed in IPA and dried with nitrogen. The use of Ti gave rise
to a cleaner lift-off and improved Au adhesion. Using a relatively thin
Au layer (50 nm nominal instead of 100 nm) also improved lift-off
quality. Dektat profiler measurements of combined metal layer
thicknesses after lift-off are described in
Section~\ref{sec-electrodes}.

\hypertarget{sec-dep-carbon-nanotubes}{%
\subsection{Deposition of Carbon
Nanotubes}\label{sec-dep-carbon-nanotubes}}

Carbon nanotubes were deposited before the alignment markers
photolithography step on all wafers fabricated between Aug 2021 \(-\)
Feb 2023, while devices fabricated before Aug 2021 and after Feb 2023
had the alignment markers photolithography step performed before the
deposition of carbon nanotubes. The process order was first switched in
Aug 2021 as this order led to faster processing times. However, the
order was switched back in Feb 2023 to minimise the exposure of carbon
nanotubes to photolithographic chemical processes. The original,
solvent-based deposition process for the carbon nanotube network is as
follows. 10 mg of 2-mercaptopyridine (99\%, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved
in 1 mL ethanol by sonication until clear. Quarter wafers were sonicated
in acetone for 3 min, then exposed to O\(_2\) plasma at 100 W for at
least 2 min in a small plasma cleaner (Plasma Etch, Inc., PE-50 Compact
Benchtop Plasma Cleaning System) or reactive ion etcher (Oxford
Instruments, Plasmalab\(^\circledR\) 80 Plus) under 300 mTorr pressure.
The cleaned SiO\(_2\)/Si surface was then coated with 2-mercaptopyridine
for 10 minutes, rinsed with ethanol to remove residual
\(2\)-mercaptopyridine, and then nitrogen dried.

Meanwhile, 5 µg of 99\% semiconducting carbon nanotube bucky paper
(NanoIntegris, IsoNanotubes S-99) was dispersed in 10 mL of anhydrous
1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB, Sigma Aldrich) by ultrasonication until no
particles were visible to the naked eye. During this time, the
ultrasonic bath temperature was kept between 20-30°C or the buckypaper
would not disperse successfully. The substrates were then placed into a
dish with CNT-DCB suspension and left covered for 1 hour, dipped into
ethanol for 10 min to remove residual solvent and any unattached carbon
nanotube bundles, and then dried with nitrogen. Devices fabricated using
films deposited in this manner are referred to in this thesis as
`solvent-deposited' networks.

\hypertarget{surfactant-based}{%
\subsubsection*{Surfactant-Based}\label{surfactant-based}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Surfactant-Based}

Two different approaches were used to attach the surfactant-dispersed
carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to the substrate surface. The first approach was
a simple drop-casting method, while the second was performed in the
presence of steam (`steam-assisted'). In both approaches, the quarter
wafers were first rinsed with ultrapure deionised water (DI water),
acetone and IPA. Next, they were placed into a small plasma cleaner
(Plasma Etch, Inc, PE-50 Compact Benchtop Plasma Cleaning System) or
reactive ion etcher (Oxford Instruments, Plasmalab 80 Plus) and exposed
to O\(_2\) plasma at 100 W for at least 2 min under 300 mTorr pressure
to make the surface hydrophilic. 1 mL of poly-L-lysine (PLL) was
immediately deposited onto each quarter wafer and left for 5 minutes.
The quarter wafers were then rinsed for 30 s with DI water and dried
with N\(_2\) gas. The presence of the PLL on the plasma cleaned surface
strengthens the surface adhesion of semiconducting single carbon
nanotubes after the surfactant dispersion has been dropcast onto the
substrate.

For carbon nanotube network films deposited in surfactant without steam
present, 2 mL of IsoNanotubes-S 90\% or 99\% dispersion (NanoIntegris)
was decanted into a small bottle and sonicated for 5 s to break up
bundles of CNTs\footnote{The composition of the surfactant used in the
  dispersion is proprietary to NanoIntegris.}. An even spread of 400 µL
carbon nanotube dispersion was placed in the centre of the
PLL-functionalised quarter wafer, covered with a glass dish and left for
10 minutes. The dispersion was then rinsed off with DI water and IPA,
and the quarter wafer was dried with N\(_2\) gas. Next, the quarter
wafer was annealed in a vacuum oven at 150°C for 1 hour to remove
residual surfactant. This method often leads to an inhomogeneous spread
of CNTs across the quarter wafer surface, which is demonstrated by the
variability in electrical properties of the resulting devices. For
further discussion of this variability, see \textbf{?@sec-cnt-devices}.

For carbon nanotube network films deposited in surfactant in the
presence of steam, 2 mL of IsoNanotubes-S 90\% or 99\% dispersion
(NanoIntegris) was decanted into a small bottle and burst-sonicated once
to break up bundles of carbon nanotubes. Subsequently, 75 mL of 95°C
water was placed into a glass dish on a hotplate held at 95°C. After
this, the PLL-functionalised quarter wafer was placed in the centre of
an insulating surface on the same hotplate. The carbon nanotube
dispersion was carefully spread across the surface of the wafer without
spilling any over the wafer edges. The wafer on the insulating surface
and glass dish were then left under the same glass dish for 2 minutes to
expose the wafer to steam from the glass dish. The use of an insulating
surface meant that the wafer and dispersion were not heated from below
while exposed to steam. The steam-assisted deposition setup is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-steaming-method}, where (a) shows the top and (b) shows
the side view of the process.

The carbon nanotube dispersion was then rinsed off the wafer with DI
water, ethanol, acetone and IPA, and then the quarter wafer was dried
with N\(_2\) gas. As in the original method, the quarter wafer was then
annealed in a vacuum oven at 150°C for 1 hour to remove residual
surfactant. This method gave an even spread of CNTs across the quarter
wafer surface, leading to a greater consistency in performance between
devices. Further details can be found in \textbf{?@sec-cnt-devices}.
Devices fabricated using films deposited in this manner are sometimes
referred to here as ``steam-deposited'' or ``steam-assisted
surfactant-deposited'' networks (rather than simply
``surfactant-deposited'', to avoid confusion with the steam-free
method).

Plasma etching was then used to remove all carbon nanotubes or graphene
outside specific areas on the device surface. Rectangular regions of
AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518 were photolithographically patterned onto each
substrate to cover and preserve the nanomaterial at the eight channel
locations of each device. The dimensions of each rectangular region on
the mask used for patterning were 1000 µm in length and 100 µm in width,
with a pitch of 1200 µm. After development, the patterned substrate was
exposed to 200 W oxygen plasma at 600 mTorr in a reactive ion etcher or
RIE (Plasmalab\(^\circledR\) 80 Plus, Oxford Instruments) to remove
unwanted nanomaterial. The etch time was 3 minutes for carbon nanotube
quarter wafers, and 1 minute for graphene chips. The protective
photoresist was then removed by soaking in acetone for at least 5
minutes. The graphene channel feature after etching is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-microscope-graphene-channel}.

or `cat ears' features.}

\end{figure}

The source and drain electrode regions for each channel were patterned
using photolithography with either AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518 photoresist
(pre-Mar 2023) or AZ\(^\circledR\) nLOF 2020 photoresist (post-Mar
2023). A 400 µm width was used for each electrode region on the mask
used for patterning, with a 40 µm gap between the source and drain
electrode regions. Each electrode gap is bridged by the nanomaterial
channel. Before metal deposition, the developed photoresist pattern was
exposed to O\(_2\) plasma at 50 W for up to 5 s or at 20 W for \(20-25\)
s in a PE-50 plasma cleaner (Plasma Etch, Inc.) to remove residual
photoresist on the developed regions and ensure a clean lift-off. As
with the alignment markers deposition (see Section~\ref{sec-align}),
before Jun 2022 chromium was used for the Au adhesion layer, and after
Jun 2022 Ti was used. A 20 nm nominal Ti thickness instead of 10 nm
nominal thickness was found to give better electrode adhesion to the
substrate, and devices after Feb 2023 were made using this thicker
adhesion layer. Good electronic contact could be made with electrodes
with a nominal Au layer thickness of \(60-100\) nm, and a Au layer
nominally 100 nm thick was most commonly used.

After metal deposition, the substrate was soaked in acetone for at least
2 hours for photoresist lift-off, then washed in IPA and dried with
nitrogen. A graphene channel after successful lift-off is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-microscope-electrodes} (a). Because of its effectiveness
as a photoresist stripping agent, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was
sometimes used instead of acetone between Jul 2021 and Feb 2023
\autocite{Microchemicals2}. However, this approach was eventually
abandoned due to occasional unwanted interaction between the dimethyl
sulfoxide and the nanomaterial channel.
Figure~\ref{fig-microscope-electrodes} (b) shows damage by the DMSO to
the gold electrodes and graphene channel during lift-off. It is possible
that the damage results from the relative effectiveness of DMSO when
removing crosslinked photoresist. High wafer temperatures during the
metal evaporation can crosslink residual photoresist surrounding the
channel nanomaterial, leading to nanomaterial being attached more firmly
to resist than the surrounding substrate. The dimethyl sulfoxide may
then remove the crosslinked resist, which brings along the attached
nanomaterial. However, it is also possible that prolonged exposure to
DMSO alone was sufficient to detach nanomaterial from the substrate.
Either way, acetone was the preferred agent for lift-off despite clearly
being a less efficient stripping agent than DMSO.

Example height profiles of quarter wafer channels taken using a Veeco
Dektat 150 profiler are shown in Figure~\ref{fig-electrodes-dektat}.
AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518 photoresist was used in
Figure~\ref{fig-electrodes-dektat} (a) and
Figure~\ref{fig-electrodes-dektat} (b) for photolithographic patterning.
A 10 nm adhesion layer and 100 nm Au layer were used for each quarter
wafers to ensure a consistent comparison. From these figures, a Cr/Au
electrode height of \(42\pm1\) nm and a Ti/Au electrode height of
\(48\pm2\) nm were measured, slightly less than half the respective
heights stated on the Inficon Deposition Controller. Although using
AZ\(^\circledR\) nLOF 2020 photolithography involves more processing
steps, it gave rise to more cleanly-defined electrodes with a more
consistent height profile. Often electrode deposition using
AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518 photoresist would lead to sharp vertical spikes
along the edge of the electrode, as seen in
Figure~\ref{fig-electrodes-dektat} (c). These edge spikes or `cat ears'
can partially or fully protrude through thin encapsulation materials
such as SU8 and Al\(_2\)O\(_3\), leading to significant leakage currents
from the electrodes into the FET top gate. This effect is due to the
profile of positive resists being suboptimal for lift-off processes, as
discussed in Section~\ref{sec-photolithography}.

The height profile corresponding to a wafer with electrodes fabricated
using AZ\(^\circledR\) nLOF 2020 is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-electrodes-dektat} (d). A 20 nm Ti adhesion layer and
100 nm Au layer were used for both Figure~\ref{fig-electrodes-dektat}
(c) and Figure~\ref{fig-electrodes-dektat} (d) to ensure a consistent
comparison, resulting in a measured electrode height of \(103\pm2\) nm
for both wafers. A comparison of these figures indicates that
AZ\(^\circledR\) nLOF 2020 photoresist has a more consistent electrode
height profile across the wafer surface than the wafer which used
AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518 resist. The measured edge features for the
AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518 resist electrodes vary in size from 20 nm to 450
nm above the bulk electrode surface, whereas the edge features for the
AZ\(^\circledR\) nLOF 2020 resist do not exceed 14 nm in height.

\hypertarget{sec-encapsulation}{%
\subsection{Encapsulation}\label{sec-encapsulation}}

Several different approaches were used for the encapsulation, or contact
protection, of devices. The encapsulation of graphene and
carbon-nanotube transistors for biosensing is essential to improve
transistor characteristics, passivate the electrodes and ensure only the
nanomaterial region is active during biosensing, as discussed in
\textbf{?@sec-biosensor-methods}. Before encapsulation photolithography
the carbon-nanotube network quarter wafers were cleaved into individual
11 mm \(\times\) 11 mm chips, using the cleaving process outlined in
Section~\ref{sec-dep-carbon-nanotubes}. Cleaving the devices at this
step ensured consistent thickness across photoresist encapsulated
devices, giving a less variable photolithographic pattern after UV
exposure and development.

Two different photolithography masks were used for encapsulation
photolithography in this work, with different exposed areas of active
nanomaterial. The first mask was used for devices made before Jan 2023,
which had a rectangular region of 500 µm \(\times\) 10 µm as the pattern
for the unencapsulated region of each channel. The second mask was used
exclusively after Jan 2023, and had a rectangular region of 200 µm
\(\times\) 20 µm for the unencapsulated region of each channel. This
change was made to double the area of carbon nanotubes exposed to
electrolyte while halving the area of SiO\(_2\) dielectric exposed to
electrolyte during aqueous sensing.
Figure~\ref{fig-microscope-encapsulation} (a) shows the encapsulation
pattern resulting from using the old mask for UV exposure, while the
encapsulation pattern resulting from using the new mask is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-microscope-encapsulation} (b). The Dektat profiles of
three different devices encapsulated using the old mask as used in
Figure~\ref{fig-microscope-encapsulation} (a) are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-microscope-encapsulation} (a) and
Figure~\ref{fig-microscope-encapsulation} (b) for AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518
and SU8 resist respectively, while AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518 and SU8
profiles encapsulated using the new mask as used in
Figure~\ref{fig-microscope-encapsulation} (b) are shown for in
Figure~\ref{fig-dektat-encapsulation} (c) and
Figure~\ref{fig-dektat-encapsulation} (d) respectively. The profiles
corresponding to the mask used after Jan 2023 clearly exhibit greater
device-to-device consistency, partly due to the mask requiring a greater
level of accuracy when aligning the encapsulation pattern with the
electrode channel. The larger feature size also means development time
has less of an impact on the quality of the encapsulation opening.

\end{figure}

Two types of photoresist were initially trialled for encapsulation of
carbon nanotube network devices, AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518 and SU8-2150.
Both AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518
\autocite{Murugathas2018,Murugathas2019a,Shkodra2021} and SU8 have been
previously used for device encapsulation, with SU8 noted for being
particularly stable and biocompatible
\autocite{Lee2006,Chen2021,Albarghouthi2022}. Once developed, the
photoresist pattern was exposed to O\(_2\) plasma at 50 W for up to 5 s
or at 20 W for \(20-25\) s to remove excess photoresist from the
encapsulation opening. Devices were then hardbaked at 200\(^\circ\)C for
1 hour to fully crosslink the encapsulation layer. This crosslinking
ensured subsequent device exposure to solvent did not remove the
photoresist encapsulation.

The exposed region clear of AZ \(^\circledR\) 1518 resist was
\(6.8 \pm 0.3\) µm in width when using the old, pre-2023 mask, while the
exposed region was \(16.6 \pm 0.4\) µm wide when using AZ\(^\circledR\)
1518 with the new mask from 2023, as seen in
Figure~\ref{fig-dektat-encapsulation} (a) and
Figure~\ref{fig-dektat-encapsulation} (c). However, the exposed region
was reduced for the SU8 encapsulation relative to the AZ\(^\circledR\)
1518, with an width of only 3.6 \(\pm\) 0.5 µm for the pre-2023 mask, as
seen in Figure~\ref{fig-dektat-encapsulation} (b). Photoresist
development using SU8 was significantly more time-sensitive than for the
AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518. This meant when the development time was
increased to ensure a wider encapsulation opening, it was difficult to
avoid removing large areas of photoresist across the entire surface of
the encapsulation. It was therefore particularly important to use the
new mask from 2023 to maximise the exposed channel region when
fabricating SU8 devices. Figure~\ref{fig-dektat-encapsulation} (d) shows
that the new mask from 2023 with the SU8 resist gave a significantly
improved exposed region width of 13.8 \(\pm\) 1.0 µm.

A thinner encapsulation layer could be achieved by depositing SU8
photoresist instead of AZ1518. Figure~\ref{fig-dektat-encapsulation}
demonstrates that the AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518 encapsulation layer had a
average height of 1.7 \(\pm\) 0.2 µm, while the SU8 encapsulation layer
had a average height of 680 \(\pm\) 20 nm. The SU8 also had much less
significant edge features than the AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518, regardless of
the profiles of the source and drain electrodes. As noted previously,
for both resists the overall profile was more consistent for the new,
2023 mask from device to device than for the old pre-2023 mask.
AZ\(^\circledR\) 1518 encapsulation was used for all graphene devices
fabricated.

\hypertarget{dielectric-encapsulation}{%
\subsubsection*{Dielectric
encapsulation}\label{dielectric-encapsulation}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Dielectric encapsulation}

Another approach taken was encapsulation of electrode channels with a
dielectric metal oxide/ceramic layer. A electron beam deposition process
was used to deposit a \(100-150\) nm nominal metal oxide layer on
devices patterned with the 2023 mask using AZ\(^\circledR\) nLOF 2020
photoresist. As in Section~\ref{sec-electrodes}, the developed
photoresist pattern was exposed to O\(_2\) plasma at 50 W for up to 5 s
or at 20 W for \(20-25\) s in a PE-50 plasma cleaner (Plasma Etch, Inc.)
before ceramic deposition. Before May 2023, devices were left in
TechniStrip\(^\circledR\) MLO 07 (MicroChemicals) for \(5-10\) min for
lift-off. However, due to concerns over the impact of the constituent
chemical DMSO on the nanomaterial region (see
\textbf{?@fig-dmso-damage}), the lift-off process was altered from May
2023 onwards. After May 2023, devices were soaked in acetone for at
least 4 hours and sonicated in clean acetone for \(30-60\) s to lift-off
the photoresist, then washed in IPA and dried with nitrogen.

SiO\(_2\) as the dielectric. However, SiO\(_2\) adheres poorly to Au
without an metallic adhesive layer present, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-dektat-dielectric-layer} (a). Aluminium oxide was chosen
as an alternative as it sticks well to bulk electrode materials, is heat
and chemical resistant, has a relatively high dielectric constant and is
bio-compatible \autocite{Guarnieri2014,Albarghouthi2022,Kolodzey2000}.
Figure~\ref{fig-dektat-dielectric-layer} (b) shows the Al\(_2\)O\(_3\)
successfully adhered to the electrodes and
Figure~\ref{fig-dektat-dielectric-layer} (a) shows the layer had a clean
profile after lift-off. Unfortunately, when Al\(_2\)O\(_3\) layers
thicker than \(\sim\) 100 nm were deposited, a significant drop in
channel mobility occurred after encapsulation which made devices
unsuitable for sensing. Meanwhile, devices with encapsulation \(\sim\)
100 nm thick had significant gate current leakage through the
encapsulation layer when liquid-gated. This leakage was present even
when AZ\(^\circledR\) nLOF 2020 was used when patterning electrodes to
avoid edge spikes (as discussed in Section~\ref{sec-electrodes}).
Furthermore, Al\(_2\)O\(_3\) should not be subsequently exposed to its
etchant TMAH, meaning it was difficult to completely remove residual
photoresist from device channels after encapsulation. Alternative
approaches to high-dielectric ceramic encapsulation are discussed in
\textbf{?@sec-future-work-fabrication}.

\subsection{Atomic Force Microscopy}\label{sec-afm-characterisation}}

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used in this thesis to characterise
the morphology of carbon nanotube random networks. All AFM was performed
using a Nanosurf NaioAFM in dynamic force mode (also known as tapping
mode, oscillating mode, acoustic AC mode or intermittent-contact mode).
An ACLA probe (AppNano) was used with a tip diameter of 12 nm, height of
\(14-16\) µm and a nominal cantilever spring constant of 58 N/m. All
atomic force microscopy was performed with the Nanosurf NaioAFM on a
stabilising table under a Faraday cage, to minimise mechanical and
electromagnetic interference. A 256 \(\times\) 256 pixel resolution was
typically used. Imaging was performed in air at room temperature. AFM
images could not be taken from the small exposed channel region on the
encapsulated devices, so were instead taken from an alternate
representative region from the same process wafer as the device being
tested. Moisture adversely affected the AFM imaging process. Therefore,
films functionalised with biological materials were washed with DI water
and gently dried with N\(_2\) before atomic force microscope images were
taken. The open source data analysis software Gwyddion (version 2.59)
was used to analyse AFM images. This included levelling the background
with the polynomial background removal function, removing scarring and
zeroing the z-scale.

\hypertarget{sec-raman-characterisation}{%
\subsection{Raman Spectroscopy}\label{sec-raman-characterisation}}

Raman spectroscopy was used in this thesis to detect defects in the
carbon nanotube network and the presence of functionalisation linker
molecules. It was performed with a HORIBA Jobin Yvon LabRAM HR800 Raman
spectrometer. The wavelength and power used for laser excitation of
samples were 514 nm and 1 mW respectively. Spectra were taken with a
1800 line holographic grating with 300 µm grating hole size. An
accumulation time of 20 seconds was used when taking spectra. Each
spectrum was recorded twice at ten positions within a 40 µm \(\times\)
100 µm rectangular region on a carbon nanotube film, with a vertical
spacing of 10µm and horizontal spacing of 20 µm between each position.
Spectra were collected over two wavenumber ranges at each position, with
the first range between 100 cm\(^{-1}\) and 650 cm\(^{-1}\), and the
second between 1300 cm\(^{-1}\) and 1650 cm\(^{-1}\). Data collected at
the final, tenth position was often much noiser than all other
measurements taken due to an unclear experimental issue, and this data
was therefore discarded.

electrical connections to the three source measure units, SMU 1, SMU 2
and SMU 3.}

\end{figure}

Both liquid-gated and back-gated electrical measurements were taken of
carbon nanotube and graphene devices to investigate their performance.
All measurement setups used had the same basic configuration, with two
source measure units (SMUs) attached to the source and gate. \(V_{ds}\)
was applied between the source SMU (SMU 1) and the drain SMU (SMU 2),
while \(V_{g}\) was applied between the gate SMU (SMU 3) and the drain
SMU. The drain SMU was held at 0 V or connected to a ground plane. Drain
current \(I_{d}\) was measured at the drain SMU, and gate leakage
current \(I_{g}\) was measured at the gate SMU. Voltage from the source
and gate SMUs was either kept constant or varied, with only one SMU
voltage varied at a time. Three different measurement setups were used
for taking these measurements, the Agilent (Keysight/HP) 4156C
semiconductor parameter analyser, the Keysight B1500A semiconductor
device analyser, and a National Instruments NI-PXIe modular measurement
system with a 8 GB PXIe-8821 controller and two NI-4138 source measure
units in the system chassis.

Liquid-gated measurements were taken using the configuration shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-liquid-gate}. Ag/AgCl standard electrodes were used as
the liquid-gate electrode. The electrode was submerged in 80 µL of
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution in a polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) `well'. The well is a flexible structure or container used to
contain the PBS solution. with outer dimensions of 12 mm \(\times\) 6 mm
\(\times\) 6 mm. This PDMS well was sonicated in isopropanol for 10 min
and thoroughly N\(_2\) dried before use. Microscope images of the PDMS
surface before and after this cleaning step are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-PDMS-clean} (a) and Figure~\ref{fig-PDMS-clean} (b)
respectively. The end of Ag/AgCl standard electrode to be submerged was
rinsed in DI water and left to sit in DI water for 15 minutes before
each characterisation. When using the Agilent 4156C semiconductor
parameter analyser or Keysight B1500A semiconductor device analyser for
liquid-gated measurements, a Faraday-caged Rucker and Kolls 666 probe
station with micromanipulators was used to contact the devices. When
using the National Instruments NI-PXIe system for liquid-gated
measurements, a custom-made chip carrier with spring-loaded,
pointed-tip, Au-coated pogo pins was used.

Back-gated measurements were taken with a Cu plane placed underneath the
Si/SiO\(_2\) wafer and connected to SMU 3. The Agilent 4156C
Semiconductor Parameter Analyser and Keysight B1500A Semiconductor
Device Analyser were used for back-gated measurements of devices within
the vapour delivery system device chamber. When the lid of this chamber
was tightly sealed, it acted as a Faraday cage for another custom-made
chip carrier with spring-loaded Au-coated pogo pins, able to contact
four channel electrode pairs at once. The Si back was pressed by the
pins against a Cu block, connected electrically to the gate SMU. The
design of the chamber chip carrier printed circuit board (PCB) is shown
in Figure~\ref{fig-device-interface} (a). The 0.5 mm through holes
connect the PTFE-coated wires, which then connect to the output cable,
while the 1.75 mm through holes are for attaching the sleeves of
Au-coated pogo pins. These pogo pins contact the device within the
chamber. 2 × 2.5 mm solder pads have been placed around the 1.75 mm
throughholes for better contact with the pogo pin sleeves. The circuit
board was placed within two layers of PTFE casing for mounting and
protection from vapour within the chamber. The wired interface is shown
in Figure~\ref{fig-device-interface} (b), where the PTFE block is
protecting the encased circuit board. The Faraday-cage Rucker and Kolls
probe station was used for all back-gated measurements taken outside the
vapour sensing chamber.

Custom programs for National Instruments LabView 2017 were used for
measurements from the Agilent 4156C Semiconductor Parameter Analyser and
the National Instruments NI-PXIe. Keysight EasyEXPERT software was used
for characterisation with the Keysight B1500A Semiconductor Device
Analyser. Liquid-gated transfer characteristics of carbon nanotube FETs
were measured at V\(_{\mathrm{ds}}\) = 100 mV and liquid-gated transfer
characteristics of graphene FETs were measured at V\(_{\mathrm{ds}}\) =
1 V, where V\(_{\mathrm{lg}}\) was swept between -0.5 V and 1 V in both
the forward and reverse direction with a step size of either 10 or 20
mV. Backgated transfer characteristics of carbon nanotube FETs were
either measured at V\(_{\mathrm{ds}}\) = 100 mV or V\(_{\mathrm{ds}}\) =
1 V, where V\(_{\mathrm{bg}}\) was swept between -5 V and 5 V or -10 V
and 10 V in the forward and reverse directions with a step size of 50 mV
or 100 mV.

A liquid-gated setup was used for aqueous-phase sensing and a back-gated
setup in the vapour delivery system was used for vapour-phase sensing.
Sensing measurements were performed with constant source-drain and gate
voltages. The gate voltage used was chosen by locating the subthreshold
region of the device transfer characteristics and choosing a voltage
that fell within this region, usually V\(_{\mathrm{g}}\) = 0 V. Using
the NI-PXIe with the PXIe-2737 module, eight-channel multiplexed current
measurements could be taken in rapid succession. An integration time of
200 or 400 ms was used for sampling with each channel, with the actual
sampling rate set by the NI-PXIe. In practice this meant a sampling rate
of 1.81 s (for 200 ms integration time) or 3.41 s (for 400 ms
integration time) for any given channel. A 200 ms integration time meant
the time between samples from successive channels varied between 220 ms
\(-\) 230 ms, while a 400 ms integration time meant the time between
samples was consistently 426 ms. The Keysight equipment used a constant
1 s sampling interval.

When sensing in an aqueous environment, 200 µL of PBS was added to the
PDMS well and 100-120 µL of PBS was removed. This initial step was
performed to wet the sides of the PDMS well, and check that the
attachment of the PDMS well to the device would not detach or become
unsealed when larger volumes of PBS were added during sensing. Before
any sensing measurement, a transfer characteristic curve was taken of
the liquid-gated device. The initial amount of PBS in the well was 100
µL, unless specified otherwise.

From Feburary 2022 onwards, the standard sensing addition series
comprised a control series and an analyte sensing series. The control
series was performed as part of each sensing experiment to test for
unwanted responses to PBS and to allow baseline drift to settle. The
total control series interval was 1800 s. PBS additions of 20 µL were
made at 100 s, 200 s and 300 s, while PBS subtractions of 20 µL were
made at 400 s, 500 s and 600 s. Immediately after the control series, a
sensing sequence was performed as part of the same continuous
measurement set. An initial PBS addition was performed at 2100s, to
confirm no changes occurred during the control series that would
interfere with sensing. Unless specified otherwise, five analyte
additions were then made with a time spacing of 300 s, at 2400 s, 2700
s, 3000 s, 3300 s and 3600 s. The experimental series was set to finish
at 4000 s. The exact timings, analyte concentrations and gate voltage
used in a given sensing sequence are discussed alongside the relevant
experimental results.

Various vapour exposure procedures were used during vapour sensing
measurements. These procedures were performed using the vapour delivery
system, and are described in further detail in
\textbf{?@sec-vapour-sensing-biosensors} and
\textbf{?@sec-pristine-characteristics}.

\hypertarget{sec-fluorescence-characterisation}{%
\subsection{Fluorescence
Microscopy}\label{sec-fluorescence-characterisation}}

Fluorescence microscopy was used to detect contamination on the surface
of devices and investigate the functionalisation process with
fluorescent tags. An Olympus BX63 fluorescence microscope was used for
microscopy, and was controlled using cellSens imaging software.
Microscope objectives used were all Olympus UPLSAPO/UPlanSApo,
apochromat objectives which compensate for spherical and chromatic
aberrations. Objectives had infinite aperture and a field number of
26.5. Filter cubes used included the Olympus FITC filter (excitation
wavelength range: \(467-498\) nm, emission wavelength range: \(513-556\)
nm), Texas Red (excitation wavelength range: \(542-582\) nm, emission
wavelength range: \(604-644\) nm) and GFP (excitation wavelength range:
\(457-487\) nm, emission wavelength range: \(502-538\) nm). The ISO
sensitivity was kept at the lowest available setting, ISO200. All
microscopy was performed in darkness with the screen turned away from
the microscope. To ensure photobleaching did not adversely affect
imaging, images were taken soon after initial exposure to fluorescence
and taking repeated photos of the same region was avoided.

\hypertarget{summary}{%
\section{Summary}\label{summary}}

Several approaches were trialled when depositing a carbon nanotube
network for the fabrication of transistor devices, which fall under the
general categories of solvent-deposited, surfactant-deposited and
surfactant-deposited with steam present. Standard photolithographic
methods were used to successfully fabricate carbon nanotube and graphene
field effect transistor devices. A range of photolithography types,
electrode materials and encapsulation materials were trialled to find
the optimal device composition for sensing. Atomic force microscopy,
fluorescence microscopy and a variety of electrical measurements were
used to characterise the devices. Device characterisation was performed
first directly after fabrication, to probe device sensitivity and
investigate the presence of defects or contamination, and again after
functionalisation, to verify the presence of functionalised material.
Pristine device characteristics can be found in
\textbf{?@sec-pristine-characteristics}, while functionalised device
characteristics can be found in
\textbf{?@sec-noncovalent-functionalisation} and
\textbf{?@sec-biosensing-iORs}.

The code used for general analysis of field-effect transistor devices in
this thesis was written with Python 3.8.8. Contributors to the code used
include Erica Cassie, Erica Happe, Marissa Dierkes and Leo Browning. The
code is located on GitHub and the research group OneDrive, and is

\hypertarget{sec-histogram-analysis}{%
\section{Atomic Force Microscope Histogram

The purpose of this code is to analyse atomic force microscope (AFM)
images of carbon nanotube networks in .xyz format taken using an atomic
force microscope and processed in Gwyddion (see
Section~\ref{sec-afm-characterisation}). It was originally designed by
Erica Happe in Matlab, and adapted by Marissa Dierkes and myself for use
in Python. The code imports the .xyz data and sorts it into bins 0.15 nm
in size for processing. To perform skew-normal distribution fits, both
\emph{scipy.optimize.curve\_fit} and \emph{scipy.stats.skewnorm} modules
are used in this code.

\hypertarget{sec-raman-analysis}{%
\section{Raman Spectroscopy Analysis}\label{sec-raman-analysis}}

The purpose of this code is to analyse a series of Raman spectra taken
at different points on a single film (see
Section~\ref{sec-raman-characterisation}). Data is imported in a series
of tab-delimited text files, with the low wavenumber spectrum (100
cm\(^{-1} - 650\) cm\(^{-1}\)) and high wavenumber spectrum (1300
cm\(^{-1} - 1650\) cm\(^{-1}\)) imported in separate datafiles for each
scan location.

\hypertarget{sec-field-effect-transistor-analysis}{%
\section{Field-Effect Transistor
Analysis}\label{sec-field-effect-transistor-analysis}}

The purpose of this code is to analyse electrical measurements taken of
field-effect transistor (FET) devices. Electrical measurements were
either taken from the Keysight 4156C Semiconductor Parameter Analyser,
National Instruments NI-PXIe or Keysight B1500A Semiconductor Device
Analyser as discussed in Section~\ref{sec-electrical-characterisation};
the code is able to analyse data in .csv format taken from all three
measurement setups. The main Python file in the code base consists of
three related but independent modules: the first analyses and plots
sensing data from the FET devices, the second analyses and plots
transfer characteristics from channels across a device, and the third
compares individual channel characteristics before and after a
modification or after each individual modification in a series of
modifications. The code base also features a separate config file and
style sheet which govern the behaviour of the main code. The code base
was designed collaboratively by myself and Erica Cassie over GitHub
using the Sourcetree Git GUI.
