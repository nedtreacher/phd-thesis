The ability to detect volatile organic compounds in a highly sensitive and selective manner is desirable for a variety of different applications, including diagnosing illnesses at a remote clinic, monitoring air in an industrial workplace, or identifying biomarkers from invasive organisms at a biosecurity checkpoint. This thesis therefore investigates the coupling of insect odorant receptors (iORs) with carbon nanotube network field-effect transistors (CNT FETs) and graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) to create a sensitive and selective vapour-phase sensor or ‘bioelectronic nose’. \\[5pt] The properties of three distinct carbon nanotube network morphologies were compared to understand their relative suitability as transducer thin films for the bioelectronic nose. The first morphology was obtained by depositing ultrasonicated carbon nanotubes in solvent, the second by depositing carbon nanotubes in surfactant solution, and the third by depositing with surfactant in the presence of steam. Compared to the other morphologies used, the steam-assisted deposition devices were found to have highly consistent device-to-device electrical properties due to their relatively low bundling and dense coverage of the substrate (>70\%). The steam-assisted deposition devices, however, were found to be more highly \textit{p}-doped than the other morphologies, with a relatively large liquid-gated threshold voltage (0.37 V). The sensitivity of the transducer was verified using an aqueous phosphate buffered saline (PBS) dilution series which followed a logarithmic trend. To account for baseline drift due to hysteresis, the device was left at a constant voltage for 30 minutes before the dilution series. By allowing baseline drift to settle over this period, it could be reasonably approximated as linear, estimated using a linear fit and removed from the data. \\[5pt] A vapour delivery system was also adapted for the purpose of testing the bioelectronic nose in a vapour environment. A photoionisation detector (PID) and a relative humidity and temperature indicator (RHI) were added to the existing system, which could be used to non-selectively detect vapours for comparison with measurements taken by the bioelectronic nose. Two new mass flow controllers (MFCs) were also added to the system to allow for a greater range of flow rates. A new electronic control system was also created to integrate the new MFCs and RHI. In the upgraded vapour delivery system, MFC-controlled nitrogen flow bubbles through analyte, carrying vapour into a device characterisation chamber, and then into a manifold leading to the PID and RHI. A steam-assisted deposition CNT FET was found to be sensitive to ppb concentrations of ethyl hexanoate (EtHex) and \textit{trans}-2-hexen-1-al (E2Hex). Baseline drift from hysteresis was found to be significantly larger when backgated in the vapour delivery system, and a 40 minute period was therefore used when waiting for baseline drift to settle. \\[5pt] One of the major challenges encountered in this thesis was the variability in quality of the non-covalent functionalisation method used. 1-pyrenebutanoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (PBASE) was primarily used as a linker molecule to attach the iORs to carbon nanotubes and graphene. This linker is widely used in the literature, but there is little agreement on the optimal process variables to use. It was verified that PBASE and iOR nanodiscs were successfully attaching to the transistor channel with a method previously used for iOR functionalisation. However, devices functionalised in an identical manner would rarely operate as expected and usually showed no sensing activity. It was found that devices which showed no sensing activity also exhibited no change in transfer characteristics after functionalisation, despite iOR nanodiscs being present. A possible explanation for this behaviour is the presence of a contamination layer which electrically isolates iOR nanodiscs from the transducer material. A device functionalised with pyrene-PEG-biotin (PPB) and avi-tagged OR10a after the use of a destructive oxygen plasma cleaning step responded to low fM concentrations of methyl salicylate (MeSal), further supporting this hypothesis. It was concluded that successful and reproducible vapour sensing using non-covalent functionalisation may require a robust, non-destructive cleaning method for the transducer platform.

I first acknowledge the land: the land of my ancestors, and the land of the first peoples to which my ancestors travelled. Knowledge cannot exist without people, and people cannot exist without a place to stand.\\[5pt]
I chose to start my doctoral studies just a few months into a global pandemic. Completing a challenging project with a worldwide crisis in the background might have been impossible without the supervision of AProf. Natalie Plank. Her ability to adapt to and overcome any problem has taught me that there is no situation which is truly unmanageable. I am deeply grateful for her leadership throughout a time of mass chaos. \\[5pt] I started this project with minimal formal training in biological science, coming from a primarily physics and engineering background. The immense support I received from Dr Melissa Jordan and Dr Colm Carraher from Plant and Food Research to complete this project meant that this was not an issue, and I thank them both immensely for this. \\[5pt] I would not have been able to begin this thesis without the financial backing and support I received from the Institute for Plant and Food Research, in association with the Better Border Biosecurity (B3) programme. In particular, I would like to thank the ex-Director of B3, Dr David Teulon. I would also like to thank the donor of the Ernest Marsden Scholarship in Physics for their significant financial support during my project. \\[5pt] There are many incredibly supportive people who I worked alongside at Te Herenga Waka – Victoria University of Wellington. I would like to start off by thanking Dr Rifat Ullah, whose mentoring and kindness encouraged me to pursue further study. His work on the initial design and setup of the vapour delivery system was invaluable to me throughout this project. I am also especially grateful to Alex Puglisi, for constructing the mechanical elements of the vapour delivery system and giving me extensive feedback on the system design. I would like to thank Peter Coard, for his advice and guidance when constructing the electrical elements of the vapour delivery system. Thank you to AProf. Ben Ruck, my supportive secondary supervisor, and to AProf. Franck Natali, for always asking about my thesis in the tearoom. Thank you to Dr. Gideon Gouws for his friendly encouragement and advice. I would also like to thank Alan Rennie, Grant Franklin, Chris Lepper, Rashika Gunasekara and Pete Jebson for their substantial technical assistance with this project. \\[5pt] I was lucky enough to start my doctoral program just as a group of supportive and talented senior students were finishing, and finished just as a group of enthusiastic and talented new doctoral students were starting. A special thanks to Jenna Nyugen, Erica Happe and Erica Cassie for teaching me the fabrication processes and characterisation procedures that made this thesis happen; and a special thanks to Marissa Dierkes, Danica Fontein, Sangar Begzaad and Alireza Zare, for their incredible support throughout the thesis writing process. \\[5pt] I would like to thank everyone else I shared an office with and worked alongside, including Jackson, Will, Ali, Kira, Catherine, Janani, Ted, Kiri and Joe. I would also like to thank all the interns and summer students who contributed to this project. \\[5pt] A massive thank you to Openstar Technologies. It was an honour to work on a cutting-edge plasma physics project right here in Wellington. A particularly big thank you to Thomas, Darren, Ben and Ratu for having me as part of the team. I sincerely hope to see fusion with net energy gain in Aotearoa New Zealand within the next few years. \\[5pt] I want to thank Shodokan Aikido New Zealand for their support throughout this thesis, in particular for the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to travel to Osaka, Japan to be graded for my first dan by Nariyama Shihan. Thanks for all the training and support, Ian. Thank you to all the friends, old and new, and whānau, blood-related or not, who have supported me over these wild past few years. You know who you are. \\[5pt] Thank you to my brother, Keeson, and to my parents, Hilary and Phillip. Your support means everything to me, and I would not be where I am today without you. In particular, our Friday lunchtime cafe visits have kept me inspired and motivated me throughout the doctoral program. Thank you, thank you, thank you for your love, your compassion, and for being there for me. \\[5pt] Finally, thank you Nina. Your love has kept me going through the most difficult and most wonderful times over the last three and a half years. You are the light of my life, and I am so happy to have taken on this challenge with you by my side. \\[5pt] Arohanui and peace to you all, Eddyn (Ned)

The `bioelectronic nose', an electronic transducer modified with
elements of the animal olfactory system, has the potential to allow
specific detection of airborne volatile compounds at concentrations as
low as parts per trillion
\autocite{Glatz2011,Kwon2015,Dung2018,Kim2022a}. An ideal transducer
platform is the thin-film transistor (TFT) which is particularly
portable, simple to use, small and robust
\autocite{Kauffman2008,Khan2020}. The thin films used in these
field-effect transistors (FETs) include carbon nanotube networks and
graphene, low-dimensional nanomaterials which are both highly sensitive
and biocompatible \autocite{Shkodra2021}. The implications of successful
development of such a portable and robust bioelectronic nose are
significant. Applications could be found in high-importance fields such
as biosecurity, medicine, environmental protection and food safety
\autocite{Dung2018,Arakawa2019,Yang2017,Son2017}. For example, it has
been demonstrated that it is possible to detect invasive brown
marmorated stinkbugs based on their volatile trace \autocite{Moser2020}.
A bioelectronic nose could potentially accomplish this biosecurity task
far more cheaply and efficiently than trained sniffer dogs
\autocite{Lee2010,Moon2020,Terutsuki2020}. There has been rapid progress
in the development of bioelectronic noses using carbon nanotube
field-effect transistors (CNT FETs) and graphene field-effect
transistors (GFETs) over the past 15-20 years
\autocite{Yoon2009,Lee2010,Yang2018}.

Insect odorant receptors (iORs) enable simple invertebrates, such as the
vinegar fruit fly \emph{Drosophila melanogaster}, to distinguish between
a huge number of specific volatile compounds
\autocite{Hallem2004,Smart2008,Wicher2008,Munch2016,Bohbot2020}. Within
the past five years, a variety of \emph{Drosophila melanogaster} iORs
have been successfully coupled with highly sensitive low-dimensional
thin-film transistors (TFTs) for specific detection of fruit-like odors
in an aqueous environment \autocite{Murugathas2019a,Murugathas2020}.
iORs have also been used for sensitive and selective volatile detection
in a lipid bilayer format, but not in a portable bioelectronic nose
format \autocite{Yamada2021}. In this thesis, my aim was to investigate
whether a bioelectronic nose capable of odorant detection in a
vapour-phase environment could be constructed by coupling iORs with
TFTs. Alongside practical applications, development of a vapour-phase
bioelectronic nose using iORs may give us a greater understanding of the
mechanisms underlying insect olfaction \autocite{Lee2010}. The
transduction mechanism of nanomaterial-based iOR sensors is still
unknown, and I hope to shed further light on the biological and
electronic processes underpinning this mechanism
\autocite{Murugathas2020,Khadka2019,Cheema2021}.

\section{Thesis Outline}\label{thesis-outline}}

This thesis consists of nine chapters. The first three chapters,
including this one, are background chapters introducing the general
topics of this thesis. The fourth and fifth chapters are methods
chapters, while the next three chapters (sixth, seventh and eight)
describe the results obtained. The ninth chapter concludes the thesis
and discusses possible next steps for future research.

\textbf{Chapter 2} gives a broad description of carbon nanotube and
graphene field-effect transistors with a focus on their use in sensing
applications. The chapter begins by looking at the general structure and
properties of thin-film transistors, where key figures of merit such as
transconductance, on-off ratio, gate current and hysteresis are
described. Graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) and carbon nanotube
network field-effect transistors (CNT FETs) are then discussed in
greater detail. These descriptions include the chemical composition of
each nanomaterial, their conduction behaviour and their unique sensor
properties when integrated into a field-effect transistor as a
thin-film.

\textbf{Chapter 3} investigates existing odorant receptor-coupled
thin-film field-effect transistors in the literature. First, the
biological structure of odorant receptors and membrane formats for their
protection in vitro are discussed. Details are then provided regarding
the construction and operation of existing vertebrate odorant receptor
TFT biosensors. The structure and function of the insect odorant
receptor is then contrasted with the vertebrate odorant receptor, and
existing insect odorant receptor TFT biosensors in the literature are
discussed. The chapter finishes with a brief discussion of non-specific
binding and its role in hindering biosensor activity.

\textbf{Chapter 4} describes the fabrication of the CNT FET and GFET
transducers used in this thesis and the characterisation techniques used
to probe their behaviour. The chapter starts with an introduction to
photolithography for thin-film transistor device fabrication. Various
techniques are described for random deposition of carbon nanotube
networks to act as channels for these thin-film transistors.
Characterisation techniques described in this chapter include atomic
force microscopy (AFM), fluorescence microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and
electrical characterisation with various semiconductor device analysers.

\textbf{Chapter 5} outlines the development of a vapour delivery system
for characterisation of the insect odorant receptor functionalised TFT
biosensors in a vapour-phase environment. The vapour delivery system was
upgraded from an existing system to include new mass flow controllers,
to have greater control of flow through the system, and off the shelf
vapour sensors, to collect vapour flow data that could be used for
comparison against biosensor activity. The chapter also describes the
design and construction of an electronic interface to monitor and
control the components of the vapour delivery system. The flow rate
through the system was then calibrated and reference sensors tested.

\textbf{Chapter 6} presents the results obtained from the use of
characterisation techniques on the pristine GFETs and CNT FETs. Various
carbon nanotube (CNT) network morphologies are displayed and analysed.
The Raman spectra and electrical device parameters of these CNT network
morphologies are then discussed, along with electrical parameters from
graphene devices. The sensitivity of a dense CNT network morphology
device is then tested in both the aqueous and vapour-phase.

\textbf{Chapter 7} explores the non-covalent functionalisation of GFETs
and CNT FETs with various linker molecules for insect odorant receptor
attachment. The linker molecules tested were 1-pyrenebutanoic acid
N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (PBASE) and 1-pyrenebutyric acid (PBA) with
1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC). Pyrene-NTA and
pyrene-biotin were also investigated as other possible linker molecules.
The quality of various functionalisation approaches was then explored
with various fluorescently-tagged linker molecules and biomolecules. In
this process, various potential obstacles to successful biosensor
functionalisation were identified.

\textbf{Chapter 8} details progress made towards the creation of an
insect odorant receptor functionalised TFT biosensor for use in a
vapour-phase environment. Two different approaches are described that
gave rise to working aqueous-phase biosensors. The first
functionalisation approach, which used PBASE in methanol, led to
irreproducible results when biosensing. Possible factors causing the
unreliability of this method were then investigated. A second approach
was then designed to avoid the malign influence of any identified
factors. Biosensors functionalised using this approach were then tested
in a vapour-phase environment.

\textbf{Chapter 9} summarises the conclusions drawn from this work, and
proposes various related studies which can be undertaken to continue the
work described in this thesis.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-1}}

Out of a wide range of transducer options available for the creation of
compact, portable and highly-integrated biosensors, field-effect
transistors are among the most promising. Field-effect transistors
(FETs), initially proposed in the 1930s, consist of two conductive
electrodes on either side of a semiconducting channel, the `source' and
`drain' electrodes, alongside an isolated `gate' electrode which is
typically perpendicular to the channel. An applied electric field from
the gate electrode capacitively controls channel resistance, giving rise
to the label `field-effect'. By adjusting gate voltage, the flow of
charge carriers between source and drain can be varied over several
orders of magnitude. The ability of this simple structure to obtain a
large signal response from small changes in channel behaviour means
field-effect transistors can be used as high-quality amplifiers for
sensor applications
\autocite{Kauffman2008,Petti2016,Tran2016,Shkodra2021,Yao2021}.

Carbon nanotube network and graphene field-effect transistors (CNT FETs
and GFETs) are both examples of a class of field-effect transistors
called thin-film transistors (TFTs). Thin-film transistors were first
developed in 1962 \autocite{Weimer1962}, and are closely related to the
commonly-used metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor
(MOSFET). Unlike MOSFETs, thin-film transistors do not use the substrate
as the device channel. Instead, current passes through a semiconducting
film on the surface of the device; the films discussed here are graphene
and carbon nanotubes, two carbon-based low-dimension nanomaterials.
Since thin-film transistors do not require a conductive substrate, they
can be fabricated using light, flexible and stretchable substrates,
making them significantly more versatile than MOSFETs
\autocite{Kauffman2008,Cao2009,Petti2016,Shkodra2021}. Invisible
conductive thin-films such as metal oxides and carbon nanotube networks
can also be used to create transparent electronics \autocite{Cao2009}.
While the principle of modulating current with a gate electrode is
shared by the MOSFET and TFT, the underlying physics behind the
transistor behaviour differs between the two. The MOSFET is turned on by
the change in carrier behaviour when switching from a depletion to an
inversion mode, while this is not the case for a TFT
\autocite{Petti2016}. Details of graphene and carbon nanotube TFT
switching behaviours can be found in the subsequent sections.

\end{figure}

Two basic configurations of the thin-film transistor are the back-gated
field-effect transistor and the liquid-gated (or electrolyte-gated)
transistor. The relatively simple back-gated configuration, shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-gating-schematics} (a), uses the degenerately doped Si
substrate as the gate. The channel is isolated from the gate with a thin
SiO\(_2\) layer. A liquid-gated device, shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-gating-schematics} (b), is used for sensitive
liquid-phase analyte detection. A submerged Ag/AgCl reference electrode
is generally used as a top-gate in this configuration. The channel is
isolated from the gate by the bulk of an electrolyte solution, which can
be restricted to the channel area using a hydrophobic
polydimethylsiloxane microchamber or `PDMS well'. The electrolyte used
is typically the biofriendly phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), but other
aqueous salt solutions, polymers and ion-gels have also been used
\autocite{Avouris2007,Shkodra2021,Tran2016,Li2023}. Transistor operation
is controlled by a `drain' bias \(V_{ds}\), placed between the drain and
source electrodes, and a `gate' bias \(V_g\), placed between the gate
and source electrodes. Gate capacitance determines the influence of
\(V_g\) on drain-source current \(I_d\). In general, gate capacitance is
a series combination of geometric capacitance, \(C_{G}\), and the
quantum capacitance of the channel nanomaterial, \(C_{Q}\)
\autocite{Avouris2007,Cao2009,Heller2009a,Tran2016,Kireev2017,Li2023}.

\subsubsection*{Liquid-Gating and Debye
Length}\label{liquid-gating-and-debye-length}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Liquid-Gating and Debye Length}

Understanding the ionic behaviour of the gate electrolyte used in a
liquid-gated device setup gives insight into the gating and sensing
behaviour of the setup. When a voltage is applied at the liquid-gate,
the charged ions in solution move to form two electric double layers,
one at the interface between the electrolyte and gate electrode, and one
at the interface between electrolyte and semiconducting channel, as
shown in Figure~\ref{fig-Debye-length}. The gate capacitance is a series
combination of the capacitance of each EDL in series with quantum
capacitance \(C_{Q}\) \autocite{Heller2010,Kireev2017,Shkodra2021}. The
Gouy-Chapman-Stern model splits the EDL into two distinct regions, the
first being a compact layer of ions, the Stern layer, and the second
being a more diffuse layer, the Gouy-Chapman layer
\autocite{Tiwari2022}. The surface potential of the solid-electrolyte
interface exponentially decreases across the diffuse region of the
double-layer; the characteristic length of this potential screening is
known as Debye length, \(\lambda_D\). The typical electrolyte Debye
length is on a nanometer scale, therefore the bulk electrolyte acts as
an insulator, similar to the SiO\(_2\) dielectric in the back-gated
configuration. The Stern layer capacitance is inversely proportional to
the Debye length, and therefore decreased \(\lambda_D\) corresponds to
increased gate capacitance
\autocite{Heller2010,Ohno2015,Shkodra2021,Yao2021}.

channel thin-film. Electric double layers are present at both the
gate-electrolyte interface and semiconductor-electrolyte interface.

\end{figure}

The equation for Debye length \(\lambda_D\) in an electrolyte solution
is given by Equation~\ref{eq-debye-length}.

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-debye-length}{}{
\lambda_D = \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_0\epsilon_rk_bT}{2N_Aq^2I}}
}\label{eq-debye-length}\end{equation}

Here, \(\epsilon_0\) is vacuum permittivity, \(\epsilon_r\) is the
relative permittivity of the electrolyte, \(\k_B\) is the Boltzmann
constant, \(T\) is absolute temperature in K, \(N_A\) is the Avogadro
number, \(q\) is the elementary charge and \(I\) is ionic strength in
mmol L\(^{-1}\). When temperature is kept constant, \(\lambda_D\) only
depends on the ionic strength of the electrolyte and not on any
attributes of the gate electrode or channel
\autocite{Stern2007,Shkodra2021}. Successive dilutions of a particular
electrolyte will increase the Debye length: for \(1 \times\) PBS,
\(\lambda_D\) is \(\sim\) 1 nm, for \(0.1 \times\) PBS, \(\lambda_D\) is
\(\sim\) 2 nm, for \(0.01 \times\) PBS \(\lambda_D\) is \(\sim\) 8 nm
and so on. This means gate capacitance is directly dependent on the
electrolyte used and its concentration
\autocite{Kireev2017,Shkodra2021}. A \(1 \times\) PBS electrolyte gives
a gate capacitance several orders of magnitude larger than that of a
SiO\(_2\) back-gate. A larger capacitance significantly increases the
effect of electrostatic gating on the channel current, often described
as increased electrostatic coupling between gate and channel. A
liquid-gated device with low Debye length will therefore be highly
sensitive to electrostatic changes across a small voltage range
\autocite{Heller2010,Ohno2015,Kireev2017,Yao2021}.

However, a decreased Debye length also has disadvantages for sensing.
Electrostatic potentials outside of the electrolyte-channel electrical
double layer are effectively screened from the channel. Electrical
double layers will also form around charged receptors within the
solution. The combined screening effect means signals due to potential
changes in charged biomolecules within the bulk electrolyte will have no
effect on gating of the channel, and therefore no effect on \(I_d\).
Interactions between the analyte and any receptor element must therefore
occur within the Debye length, and so a tradeoff exists between channel
sensitivity and the size of the sensitive region above the channel. Many
medium or large proteins will require a relatively dilute electrolyte
for analyte capture to be detected by the channel, which may not reflect
the intended environment for biosensor application
\autocite{Stern2007,Piccinini2018,Shkodra2021}. Other approaches to
increasing Debye length without reducing device sensitivity have
therefore also been trialled. One approach involves attaching a layer of
polyethylene glycol polymer (PEG) to the channel, limiting the approach
of counterions. This increases Debye length at the electrolyte-channel
interface while preserving the capacitance of the electrolyte-gate
interface, keeping device sensitivity relatively high
\autocite{Gao2016,Filipiak2018,Kesler2020,Albarghouthi2022}.

The current-voltage plots of a given transistor are known as its
`characteristic curves'. The I-V curve of \(I_d\) against \(V_{ds}\) at
constant \(V_g\) is known as the `source-drain' or `output'
characteristic curve, while \(I_d\) against \(V_g\) at constant
\(V_{ds}\) is known as the `transfer' characteristic curve at that
source-drain voltage \autocite{Kauffman2008,Petti2016,Shkodra2021}.
Applying a gate voltage \(V_g\) to the gate of an thin-film transistor
influences the amount and type of available charge carriers for
conduction \autocite{Avouris2007,Tran2016,Heller2009a}. In an ambipolar
transistor, a highly negative \(V_g\) will give rise to hole conduction,
and a highly positive \(V_g\) will give rise to electron conduction
\autocite{Avouris2007,Yao2021,Li2023}. The minimum \(V_g\) required to
turn the flow of current in a thin-film transistor `on' is referred to
as the threshold voltage \(V_t\)
\autocite{Petti2016,Shkodra2021,Li2023}. Threshold voltage is discussed
in more detail in Section~\ref{sec-electrical-characterisation-CNT}.
When \(|V_{ds}| < |V_g| - |V_t|\) while \(|V_g|>|V_t|\), the device is
in the linear regime. Here, \(V_{ds}\) is directly proportional to
\(I_{d}\), similar to an Ohmic resistor. When
\(|V_{ds}| > |V_g| - |V_t|\) and \(|V_g|>|V_t|\), the device is in the
saturation regime, where the relationship between \(V_{ds}\) and
\(I_{d}\) becomes non-linear \autocite{Petti2016,Shkodra2021,Li2023}.

\end{figure}

The linear and saturation regions for a metal oxide thin-film transistor
are shown in Figure~\ref{fig-linear-region}. In this thesis, constant
\(V_g\) measurements from thin-film transistors were typically taken
when \(V_{ds}\) was small and the TFT was in the linear operation
regime. Figure~\ref{fig-gating-transfer} (a) and (c) show back-gated
transfer characteristics of a thin-film transistor, and
Figure~\ref{fig-gating-transfer} (b) and (d) show liquid-gated TFT
transfer characteristics. The back-gated device exhibits unipolar
behaviour, where the transistor conducts in only one direction along the
\(I_d - V_g\) curve, while the liquid-gated device exhibits ambipolar
behaviour, where conduction occurs along both directions of the curve.
The liquid-gated device is also able to traverse a wide range of
currents over a much more limited voltage interval than the back-gated
device. A variety of quantitative parameters or figures of merit can be
extracted from the transfer characteristics of a thin-film transistor
\autocite{Petti2016}. Transconductance and on-off ratio are discussed
below, while threshold voltage and subthreshold swing are discussed for
the carbon nanotube network case in
Section~\ref{sec-electrical-characterisation-CNT}.

One of the most important figures of merit which can be extracted from
the transfer characteristic curve of a thin-film FET is the on-off
current ratio, the ratio of the current through a device when the
transistor is gated fully `on', \(I_{on}\), to the current \(I_{off}\)
when gated fully `off'. \autocite{Kauffman2008,Petti2016,Shkodra2021}.
Having a low off current is desirable as it corresponds to low power
consumption by the transistor \autocite{Rouhi2010}. In
Figure~\ref{fig-gating-transfer} (a), there is a clear on regime at
large negative voltages and an off regime at large positive voltages.
Although the transfer curve never completely flattens in each direction,
\(I_{on}\) can be reasonably be estimated by the highest current
obtained, while \(I_{off}\) can be estimated from the lowest current
reading. In an ambipolar FET, such as that shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-gating-transfer} (b), the off current can be defined as
the minimum current during the transfer sweep, where the majority
carrier transitions from being holes to electrons or \emph{vice versa}
\autocite{Petti2016,Zheng2017}. For the backgated channel shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-gating-transfer} (a), the on-off ratio
\(I_{on}/I_{off}\) is \(\sim\) 700, while for the liquid-gated device in
Figure~\ref{fig-gating-transfer} (b), \(I_{on}/I_{off} \sim 3000\). The
superior on-off ratio is a significant advantage of the liquid-gated
configuration \autocite{Shkodra2021}.

In the linear regime, transconductance at a specific gate voltage is
given by \(g_m = |dI_{d}/dV_g|\). Transconductance indicates how
responsive the device is to electrostatic gating at a given gate
voltage. In other words, when \(g_m\) is large, small changes in \(V_g\)
can significantly modulate channel current \(I_d\), which is useful for
sensing \autocite{Heller2009a,Ohno2015,Kireev2017}. Transconductance at
a given gate voltage is also proportional to the mobility (movement) of
charge carriers in the device channel, and therefore depends on the
scattering properties of the material
\autocite{Rouhi2010,Petti2016,Li2023}. The transconductance at a
specific gate voltage can be found from performing a linear fit in a
small region around that voltage on the transfer curve. Linear fits for
transconductance at \(V_g = 0\) V, the operating voltage used for
sensing in this thesis, are shown for a back-gated device in
Figure~\ref{fig-gating-transfer} (a), and a liquid-gated device in
Figure~\ref{fig-gating-transfer} (b). The corresponding transconductance
values of \(g_m\) = 0.002 µS and \(g_m\) = 1 µS respectively. The
difference of several orders of magnitude between back-gated and
liquid-gated transconductance corresponds to the difference of several
orders of magnitude between back and liquid-gated gate capacitance
\autocite{Tran2016,Shkodra2021}. The ability to achieve high
transconductance at relatively low voltage is important for the creation
of low power sensors, which is another advantage of the liquid-gated
setup.

Application of higher voltages to the gate in both the liquid-gate and
back-gate cases can result in significant leakage currents through the
gate. These currents mean that the insulating layer at the gate
producing the capacitive effect no longer acts as an insulator,
adversely affecting transistor behaviour and contributing to sensor
drift that may be mistaken for signal responses to analyte
\autocite{Noyce2019,Shkodra2021,Albarghouthi2022}. In the case of
back-gated devices, gate leakage occurs due to conduction through the
oxide dielectric. If the gate voltage produces an electric field
exceeding the dielectric strength of the oxide, dielectric breakdown can
occur, where the oxide layer no longer acts as an insulator. Breakdown
results from voltage-induced oxygen vacancies in the SiO\(_2\) lattice
forming a conductive path through the insulator \autocite{Padovani2017}.
Breakdown occured at \(\sim\) 50 V for the back-gated channel in
Figure~\ref{fig-gating-transfer}. In the liquid-gated case, the
electrolyte used determines the appropriate voltage range for electrical
characterisation, since excessive voltages will induce redox reactions.
For water-based electrolytes, gate voltages must be kept within the
\(\pm\) 1 V range \autocite{Wang2010,Ohno2015,Shkodra2021}. In normal
operation, gate current should appear negligible on a linear scale, as
shown in Figure~\ref{fig-gating-hysteresis}.

\end{figure}

Thin-film transistor devices typically exhibit some degree of
hysteresis, where the history of channel current affects future current
behaviour. Hysteresis in carbon nanotube and graphene field-effect
transistors is a result of filling or emptying of slow-discharge charge
traps in the channel environment. These charge traps effectively dope
the SiO\(_2\) insulator or the insulator-channel interface, which
results from gate bias stress or dopant adsorption
\autocite{McEuen2002,Kim2003,Wang2010,Bartolomeo2011,Bargaoui2018,Peng2018}.
A capacitive gating effect from charged ions also contributes to
hysteresis, from the use of a electrolyte-gated environment or from
charged surface contamination \autocite{Wang2010,Yao2021}. Due to
hysteresis, sweeping \(V_g\) forwards across a set voltage range will
result in a different \(I_d - V_g\) characteristic curve than
subsequently sweeping over \(V_g\) in the reverse direction. Hysteresis
depends on the voltage range used for characterisation, the sweep rate
and the environment of the transistor channel
\autocite{Kim2003,Wang2010}. The effect of hysteresis on \(I_d\) when
sweeping gate voltage is shown in Figure~\ref{fig-gating-hysteresis}.
The measured hysteresis is significantly lower in the liquid-gated case,
possibly due to the smaller voltage range. However, this change may also
result from a reduction in trap states in the SiO\(_2\) layer due to the
use of a liquid-gate.

Memory effects are also present during current measurement when both
source-drain and source-gate voltages are kept constant. These changes
appear as a slow change in current, and are referred to here as either
signal drift or baseline drift. In more extreme cases, baseline drift
can obscure or even be confused with current changes attributable to
analyte interaction during real-time sensing \autocite{Noyce2019}.
Signal drift occurs both in ambient conditions and in a vacuum
environment, and cannot be accounted for by changes in room temperature
and ambient lighting alone. While research into signal drift is ongoing,
it appears to be a hysteretic effect resulting from changes in trap
states over time \autocite{Lin2006,Bargaoui2018,Noyce2019}. The high
demand for characterisation equipment in a standard device laboratory
means that waiting over three hours for baseline drift to settle is
impractical, and furthermore, extended periods of voltage application
may degrade bio-functionalised devices \autocite{Noyce2019}. Since trap
states are unavoidable to some extent
\autocite{DiMaria1993,Collins2000}, data analysis that accounts for
baseline drift was therefore explored in some detail in this thesis.

\subsection{Graphene Properties}\label{graphene-properties}}

Graphene is a 2-dimensional material which consists of covalently bonded
carbon atoms in a dense lattice of hexagonal cells
\autocite{McEuen2002,Novoselov2004,Geim2007,Tran2016}. Graphene can be
used to create a variety of low-dimensional graphitic nanomaterials,
including carbon nanotubes \autocite{McEuen2002} (see
Section~\ref{sec-carbon-nanotubes}). Monolayer and bilayer graphene are
zero band-gap semiconductors, where traversing the electronic
bandstructure in different directions gives rise to either metallic or
semiconducting behaviour \autocite{McEuen2002,Peng2018}. Adding more
graphene layers adds more complexity to the bandstructure, with
significant overlap between bands and reduced carrier mobility. When 10
or more layers are present, the structure behaves as 3-dimensional
graphite \autocite{Geim2007,Ohno2015}. First isolated and used as a
thin-film transistor channel in 2004 \autocite{Novoselov2004}, monolayer
graphene has many desirable electronic properties. Charge carrier
transport is ballistic over submicrometer distances at room temperature,
and as graphene is metallic even at the Dirac point, this transport is
not inhibited by a Schottky barrier at the metal contacts of a device
\autocite{Novoselov2004,Geim2007,Peng2018}. Graphene is also a highly
chemically stable material. In particular, it will not readily oxidise
in an electrolyte solution due to having a large `electrochemical
window'; in other words, it is too chemically stable to take part in
electrochemical reactions within a large range of applied voltages
\autocite{Ohno2015,Tran2016}.

graphene on SiO\(_2\) surface functionalised with Rhodamine B dye.
Bright lines are visible on the left side of the graphene surface which
correspond to preferential attachment of dye along the graphene folds.}

\end{figure}

Graphene folding (also referred to as warping or wrinkling) of up to
\(\sim\) 6 nanometers in height occurs at many locations on a graphene
monolayer \autocite{Zhu2012}. These folds primarily result from the
chemical vapour deposition (CVD) process onto copper used in the
creation of graphene films. The thermal contraction of copper exceeds
that of graphene during the rapid cooling that takes place after
deposition. Since the graphene is pinned to the surface, this leads to
slight folding of the monolayer
\autocite{Zhao2012,Zhu2012,Chhikara2013}. Transferring graphene from the
rough copper to a relatively smooth Si/SiO\(_2\) wafer may also
contribute to wrinkling \autocite{Zhao2012,Kireev2017}. These folds help
to mechanically stabilise the graphene layer, but have significant
negative effects on charge transport
\autocite{Geim2007,Chhikara2013,Zhu2012}. Folds also exhibit enhanced
reactivity due to their low radius of curvature \autocite{Zhao2012}.
This is demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig-graphene-folds}, where the
fluorescent Rhodamine B dye preferentially bonds to folded regions,
leading to particularly dense functionalisation in these regions. This
behaviour has previously been observed for the decoration of graphene
with pentacene molecules \autocite{Chhikara2013}. Other defects
influencing surface reactivity include grain boundaries and point
defects in the crystal structure
\autocite{Zhao2012,Chhikara2013,Kireev2017}.

\hypertarget{sec-electrical-characterisation-graphene}{%
\subsection{Electrical
Characterisation}\label{sec-electrical-characterisation-graphene}}

The transfer sweep behaviour of a graphene device is ambipolar and has
no off regime under standard conditions
\autocite{Novoselov2004,Bartolomeo2011,Ohno2015}. When a gate voltage
\(V_g\) is applied to the channel of a graphene device, the Fermi energy
of the graphene is shifted and surface charge density is altered
\autocite{Novoselov2004,Heller2010,Ohno2015}. An increase in surface
charge density means an increase in carriers available for either \(p\)
or \(n\)-conduction and increased \(I_d\) \autocite{Geim2007}. The
regions of hole conduction and electron conduction are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-graphene-characteristics} (a), alongside the
corresponding Fermi energy on the simplified graphene bandstructure
(known as a `Dirac cone'). The transconductance of the curve at \(V_g\)
= 0 V, \(g_m\) = 1 µS, is similar to the liquid-gated transconductance
of a carbon nanotube device shown earlier. As graphene lacks a bandgap,
there is a minimum possible conductance for graphene devices, which
leads to a relatively small on-off ratio
\autocite{Novoselov2004,Geim2007}. Folding may further decrease on-off
ratio due to diffusive transport of carriers along the folds
\autocite{Zhu2012}. The on-off ratio of the graphene transfer curve
shown in Figure~\ref{fig-graphene-characteristics} (a) is 5. A bandgap
can be introduced to a graphene device using a dual-gated configuration,
increasing the on-off ratio past 100 \autocite{Xia2010}.

characteristics of two graphene field-effect transistor channels. In

arrows. The relative Fermi energy at each minima is also shown on

\end{figure}

The minimum conductance obtainable by gating in a graphene device occurs
at what is known as the charge neutrality or Dirac point, where the
population of charge carriers is at a minimum
\autocite{Novoselov2004,Bartolomeo2011,Ohno2015,Kireev2017}. At gate
voltages close to the Dirac voltage, both electrons and holes are
present, and at the Dirac point, there are equal concentrations of each
carrier present \autocite{Novoselov2004,Bartolomeo2011,Peng2018}. As
shown in Figure~\ref{fig-graphene-characteristics} (a), as the gate
voltage moves left away from the Dirac voltage and Fermi energy is
shifted into the valence band, holes begin to dominate conduction, while
as gate voltage is moved to the right of the Dirac voltage, where Fermi
energy is shifted into the conduction band, electrons dominate
\autocite{Novoselov2004,Bartolomeo2011,Feng2014,Zhang2015}. At points
far from the Dirac voltage, conductivity increases linearly
\autocite{Novoselov2004,Bartolomeo2011,Peng2018}. Typically, a monolayer
graphene channel conducts holes at zero gate voltage, which results from
the presence of \(p\)-dopants such as oxygen and water adsorbed from the
air and resist residues. By removing these dopants, the Dirac point
feature can be brought closer to the zero gate voltage position on the
transfer curve, indicating graphene is naturally a mixed-carrier
conductor
\autocite{Novoselov2004,Bartolomeo2011,Zhang2015,Kireev2017,Peng2018}.

Some graphene devices naturally exhibit a double-minimum feature in the
transfer characteristic curve, corresponding to two separate Dirac
points \autocite{Bartolomeo2011,Feng2014,Zhang2015,Kireev2017,Peng2018}.
This effect is due to doping of graphene by charge transfer from the
metal contacts. In shorter length channels, metal doping affects the
entire channel length. Band bending from channel doping near the metal
contact results in a consistent Fermi level across the channel, meaning
only a single Dirac point is present in the transfer characteristic
curve. However, for longer channels, metal doping no longer occurs
across the entire channel length \autocite{Bartolomeo2011,Peng2018}.
This discrepancy leads to a difference in Fermi level between the
metal-doped graphene and graphene in the unaffected channel region
\autocite{Bartolomeo2011,Feng2014,Peng2018,Zhang2015}. The difference in
Fermi levels results in the introduction of a second Dirac point. The
relative level of doping in the metal-doped and unaffected channel
regions determines the relative \(V_g\) position of each local minimum
on the \(I_d - V_g\) curve \autocite{Bartolomeo2011,Peng2018,Zhang2015}.

Figure~\ref{fig-graphene-characteristics} (b) shows a double-minimum
transfer characteristic with each Dirac point indicated. At large
negative \(V_g\), the Fermi energy level is far from the Dirac point
energy of both the channel and contact regions, and holes dominate
conduction. As \(V_g\) and the Fermi energy approach and then pass the
Dirac point corresponding to the left minimum \(V_{D,-}\), the available
carriers likewise decrease to a minimum and begin to increase again in
one region \(R_1\), but continuously decrease in the other region
\(R_2\). The shape of the curve between \(V_{D,-}\) and the right local
minimum \(V_{D,+}\) then depends on the relative rate of increasing
electron and decreasing hole populations, where the graphene is
\(n\)-doped in \(R_1\) and \(p\)-doped in \(R_2\). At the local minimum
on the right, \(V_{D,+}\), the carriers in \(R_2\) now reach a minimum,
while carriers in \(R_1\) continue to increase. At voltages well beyond
\(V_{D,+}\), electrons then dominate conduction in both regions
\autocite{Bartolomeo2011,Zhang2015,Peng2018}.

\hypertarget{sensing-behaviour}{%
\subsection{Sensing Behaviour}\label{sensing-behaviour}}

The large surface-to-volume ratio of graphene makes it highly sensitive
to intermolecular interactions and therefore appropriate for use in
sensing applications \autocite{Ohno2015,Tran2016}. An analyte molecule
can be detected using a graphene channel by observing the change in
current that occurs when the presence of a charged analyte alters the
channel Fermi level \autocite{Heller2010,Ohno2015}. Sensing may be
dominated by interactions occurring at the graphene folds
\autocite{Zhao2012}. The small on-off ratio of graphene is a drawback
when used in field-effect transistor sensing applications when compared
with carbon nanotube transistors \autocite{Novoselov2004}. If a
dual-gate configuration is used, however, on-off ratio can be increased
significantly by introducing a bandgap. The presence of a bandgap means
a Schottky barrier is introduced at the graphene-electrode interface,
whose modulation can then also contribute as a potential sensing
mechanism (see Section~\ref{sec-cnt-network-details} for a discussion of
Schottky barriers) \autocite{Xia2010}.

\subsection{Carbon Nanotube Properties}\label{sec-carbon-nanotubes}}

Since their initial identification in 1991 \autocite{Iijima1991}, a wide
range of applications for carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been proposed,
due to their small mass, elasticity, strength, and unique electronic
properties. A single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) consists of a
monolayer graphene sheet rolled up into a cylinder, while a multi-walled
carbon nanotube (MWCNT) consists of several monolayer graphene cylinders
where smaller cylinders are coaxially contained by larger cylinders
\autocite{Dekker1999,Avouris2007,Cao2009,Rouhi2010,Shkodra2021}.
Multi-walled carbon nanotubes can suffer from significant scattering at
defects leading to diffusive electron motion \autocite{Dekker1999}.
However, single-walled carbon nanotubes are relatively defect-free, and
carrier transport within nanotubes is near-ballistic at room
temperature, resulting in high carrier mobility
\autocite{Dekker1999,Avouris2007,Cao2009,Rouhi2010,Shkodra2021}. The
momentum of charge carriers in a single-walled carbon nanotube is
quantised, confining carriers to 2-dimensional slices across the
3-dimensional graphene bandstructure. If a slice contains a bandgap, the
carbon nanotube behaves as a semiconductor (s-CNT); if not, the nanotube
behaves as a metal (m-CNT) \autocite{McEuen2002}. The high
surface-to-volume ratio of small-diameter single-walled carbon nanotubes
makes them extremely sensitive and therefore particularly suitable for
sensing applications \autocite{Cao2009,Yao2021,Shkodra2021}. Like
graphene, carbon nanotubes have a large potential window, and can be
used safely in a liquid-gate environment without undergoing redox
reactions \autocite{Ohno2015}.

graphene sheet can be rolled up at various angles to form carbon
nanotubes. The two black dotted lines represent boundaries which can be
cut across and then brought into contact to form a cylinder. The
cylinder here is referred to by the integer pair (6,4), as the chiral
vector \(C_h\), the vector perpendicular to the cut through the sheet,
is given by \(C_h = 6a_1+4a_2\). The chiral vector forms the
circumference of the rolled carbon nanotube. The left edge in the zigzag
(\(n\),0) and armchair (\(n\),\(n\)) cases are shown with a blue and
purple dotted line respectively. The location of the right edge
(diameter of the nanotube) is determined by the value chosen for \(n\).

\end{figure}

The chirality and diameter of a carbon nanotube determines its
electronic bandstructure and whether it has semiconducting or metallic
characteristics
\autocite{Martel1998,Dekker1999,McEuen2002,Avouris2007,Shkodra2021,Li2023}.
The chirality indices of a nanotube (\(n\),\(m\)) determines the chiral
angle at which hexagons wind around the nanotube relative to the
longitudinal axis of the nanotube. This chiral angle is the angle
between the chiral vector
\(\textbf{C}_h = n\textbf{a}_1+m\textbf{a}_2\), which maps to the
circumference of the nanotube, and the basis vector \(\textbf{a}_1\),
which is parallel to a row of hexagons. The size of the chiral angle
\(\theta\) is given by Equation~\ref{eq-chiral-angle}, the diameter of
the resulting carbon nanotube is given by \(d=|C_h|/\pi\)
\autocite{Lu2012}.

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-chiral-angle}{}{
\theta = \arcsin\frac{\sqrt{3}m}{2\sqrt{n^2+nm+m^2}}, \space n > m
}\label{eq-chiral-angle}\end{equation}

When \(m=0\), \(\theta = 0°\), and the resulting carbon nanotube has a
`zigzag' structure; when \(m=n\), \(\theta = 30°\), and the carbon
nanotube has an `armchair' structure. When \(\theta\) is between
\(0°-30°\), the structure is referred to as `chiral'
\autocite{Dekker1999,Lu2012}. When \(n-m=3z\), where \(z\) is an
integer, the resulting carbon nanotube is metallic \(-\) for example, if
\(n=5\) and \(m=5\), \(z=0\), therefore the tube is metallic. All other
nanotubes are semiconducting, including the (6,4) chiral nanotube
described in Figure~\ref{fig-carbon-nanotube-wrapping}. Out of the
chiral arrangements available, two-thirds of the possible structures are
semiconducting while one-third is metallic \autocite{Dekker1999}.

\hypertarget{sec-cnt-network-details}{%
\subsection{Carbon Nanotube Network
Transistors}\label{sec-cnt-network-details}}

The first carbon nanotube transistors were created in 1998, and used a
single carbon nanotube as the device channel
\autocite{Martel1998,Tans1998,Kauffman2008}. Over the following decade,
there was a general move away from the use of a single-tube as the
transistor channel towards that of a large-scale network of carbon
nanotubes. In these networks, the individual electrical properties of
the CNTs are averaged out across the network, reducing device-to-device
variation. Furthermore, the large area of coverage ensures high channel
mobility and is preferable in sensing applications
\autocite{Hu2004,Cao2009,Murugathas2019,Li2023}. The carbon nanotube
network used for the channel can either be directionally-aligned or
randomly deposited \autocite{Cao2009,Shkodra2021}; in this thesis,
randomly deposited networks were fabricated using facile
solution-deposition methods \autocite{Zheng2017,Cassie2023}. Important
attributes of a carbon nanotube film include the density of the network
(number of nanotubes per unit area), the ratio of metallic to
semiconducting nanotubes present, and the distribution of nanotube
diameters present \autocite{Cao2009,Shkodra2021}. The strong van der
Waals forces between carbon nanotubes lead to them bundling together
within a network. These bundles may contain many nanotubes of different
size and chirality \autocite{Fuhrer2000,Hu2004,Cao2009,Murugathas2019}.

The band bending which occurs at the interface between the metal
electrodes of the device and the semiconducting carbon nanotubes is
primarily responsible for CNT FET switching behaviour
\autocite{Avouris2007,Bargaoui2018}. The Fermi level difference between
materials leads to free electrons flowing across each interface until
the Fermi levels equilibrate and a electric dipole layer forms. The net
electric field created at each interface creates a space charge region
in the channel, forming a Schottky barrier which prevents the further
flow of a particular type of charge at each interface. The nature of the
band bending and resulting Schottky barrier depends on the work function
of the metal \autocite{Cowley1999,Kauffman2008,Zhang2012}. A high work
function metal bends the valence band of the semiconductor towards the
Fermi level of the metal, creating a low barrier for holes but a high
barrier for electrons \autocite{Avouris2007,Zhang2012,Bargaoui2018}.
Channel current results primarily from quantum tunnelling through
Schottky barriers. The Schottky barriers at the metal electrodes result
in one type of charge dominating flow, referred to as unipolar
behaviour. However, if the barrier size is low for both holes and
electrons, they can flow simultaneously through the channel, which is
referred to as ambipolar behaviour \autocite{Avouris2007,Heller2008}.

The behaviour of carbon nanotube network transistors is also influenced
by a variety of potential barriers existing at junctions between carbon
nanotubes. A prominent example is the Schottky barriers existing at
junctions between metallic and semiconducting nanotubes (m-s junctions)
\autocite{Fuhrer2000,Topinka2009,Murugathas2019}. These potential
barriers cause increased resistance at these junctions relative to other
points in the network \autocite{Fuhrer2000,Jang2015}. When the channel
length is much larger than that of individual nanotubes, channel current
must pass through junctions placed along percolation pathways. If only
one pathway exists across a sparse network, the network density is at
the `percolation threshold'. If a network is below the percolation
threshold, the channel cannot conduct
\autocite{Hu2004,Topinka2009,Jang2015}. When a network with density well
above percolation contains a low proportion of semiconducting nanotubes,
percolating pathways which only contain metallic nanotubes exist. A
device with this film will be highly conductive but cannot be gated
\autocite{Fuhrer2000,Topinka2009}. Fixing the density but increasing the
proportion of s-CNTs means m-s junctions become more prevalent. The
introduced Schottky barriers cause a dramatic drop in conductance. As
the proportion of s-CNTs approaches 100\%, semiconducting pathways with
no metallic junctions emerge, and conductance sharply increases once
more \autocite{Topinka2009}.

\hypertarget{sec-electrical-characterisation-CNT}{%
\subsection{Electrical
Characterisation}\label{sec-electrical-characterisation-CNT}}

Like graphene transistors, mixed-chirality carbon nanotube transistors
are naturally ambipolar: they can conduct both electrons and holes. An
applied gate voltage \(V_g\) alters the Fermi energy of the
semiconducting nanotubes, modulating the width of the Schottky barriers
present, and therefore changing the amount and type of charge flowing
through the channel \autocite{Nakanishi2002,Kauffman2008,Heller2008}.
Diameter and separation of nanotubes both influence the gate capacitance
of carbon nanotube networks alongside geometric capacitance \(C_{G}\)
and quantum capacitance \(C_{Q}\) \autocite{Rouhi2011a}. \(I_d\) mainly
consists of holes at highly negative gate voltages, and mainly consists
of electrons at highly positive voltages. At intermediary voltages, both
electrons and holes flow \autocite{Avouris2007,Yao2021}. Transistor
behaviour can be made unipolar through doping the semiconducting carbon
nanotubes or by choosing an electrode metal with a particularly high
work function, increasing the Schottky barrier for one type of charge
\autocite{Avouris2007,Kauffman2008,Cao2009,Yao2021}. For example, the
use of gold electrodes promotes \(p\)-type behaviour over \(n\)-type
behaviour due to the work function of the metal; ambient adsorption of
oxygen will weakly dope the semiconducting carbon nanotubes and likewise
promote \(p\)-type behaviour
\autocite{McEuen2002,Kauffman2008,Cao2009,Shkodra2021}.

A variety of parameters can be extracted which reflect the morphology of
the carbon nanotube network. Partial alignment of a random-network
carbon nanotube network maximises the transconductance of a device, as
this creates more semiconducting pathways, increasing current while
preserving the presence of gateable junctions within the network
\autocite{Cao2009,Rouhi2010,Rouhi2011a,Jang2015,Li2023}. The on-off
ratio of a carbon nanotube device is largely decided by the ratio of
s-CNTs to m-CNTs. The relative proportion of metallic carbon nanotubes
in the network determines the size of \(I_{off}\). Therefore, unlike a
graphene device, the off current can be readily reduced by eliminating
percolating metallic pathways for increased \(I_{on}/I_{off}\)
\autocite{Hu2004,Kauffman2008,Cao2009,Rouhi2011a}. In a liquid-gated
environment, the gate leakage current of a sparse carbon nanotube
transistor can approach \(I_d\), leading to significant device noise. A
dense network or a graphene device can therefore give enhanced
signal-to-noise ratio during sensing \autocite{Ohno2015}. Noyce \emph{et
al.} found that fully-on back-gated carbon nanotube devices typically
exhibit a \(\sim\) 3 hour period of steep signal drift, followed by
steady-state current flow. This settling behaviour was both reversible
and highly characteristic of a particular channel, and could be modelled
using a sum of three exponentials \autocite{Noyce2019}.

placed across the channel.}

\end{figure}

The threshold voltage \(V_t\) of a unipolar transistor is equal to the
gate voltage required to prevent the flow of charge carriers across the
channel, often referred to as turning the device off
\autocite{Petti2016,Shkodra2021}. In ambipolar devices, two separate
threshold voltages exist for each type of charge carrier, \(V_{t,h}\)
and \(V_{t,e}\), which are shown in Figure~\ref{fig-CNT-characteristics}
on both a linear (a) and logarithmic (b) scale. In the region between
these gate voltages, known as the subthreshold regime, both holes and
electrons flow through the channel
\autocite{Avouris2007,Reiner-Rozman2015}. If percolating pathways
consisting entirely of m-CNTs are present, \(I_{off}\) flows through
these pathways, as conduction through metallic nanotubes is largely
unaffected by changes in \(V_g\) \autocite{Fuhrer2000,Topinka2009}. If
there are no unblocked m-CNT pathways, \(I_{off}\) is entirely due to
Schottky barrier tunnelling \autocite{Avouris2007}. \(V_t\) can be
estimated by extrapolating the trendline of the linear region of the
transfer characteristics to the \(V_g\) axis. The intercept is
approximately equal to the threshold voltage when \(V_{ds}\) is close to
zero, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig-CNT-characteristics} (b)
\autocite{Sze2006,Petti2016,Li2023}. This is only a rough estimate of
the actual device \(V_t\), but is sufficient when comparing the gating
behaviour of different devices \autocite{Li2023}.

\caption{\label{fig-subthreshold-slope}A carbon nanotube network
transfer sweep with \(V_{ds}\) = 100 mV on a logarithmic scale.
Threshold voltage is shown with a black dotted line, while subthreshold
slope is shown with a red dotted line.}

\end{figure}

The subthreshold slope
\(S = d\textrm{log}_{10}(I_{d})/dV_g|_{\textrm{max}}\) is a measure of
how rapidly a transistor approaches the minimum current \(I_{off}\). The
subthreshold slope is often referred to using its reciprocal value, the
subthreshold swing, which is equivalent to the change in \(V_g\)
required to change \(I_d\) by one order of magnitude. This figure of
merit is strongly related to the gate capacitance of the device. As the
slope exponentially approaches the off current in the subthreshold
regime, it can be fitted with a linear trendline on a logarithimic
scale. \autocite{Sze2006,Petti2016}. A linear trendline fitted to the
logarithm of the subthreshold regime is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-subthreshold-slope}, where the gradient corresponds to
subthreshold slope. A high subthreshold slope exceeding than 10
decades/V is ideal for reduced power consumption of the working sensor
device \autocite{Petti2016}. The subthreshold slope of the transfer
sweep in Figure~\ref{fig-subthreshold-slope} is 8 decades/V. Heller
\emph{et al.} and Gao \emph{et al.} found that sensor devices showed
better signal-to-noise ratio when gated in the subthreshold regime, as
small voltage changes in response to analyte led to exponential current
changes along the subthreshold slope \autocite{Heller2009,Gao2010}.

\hypertarget{sec-CNT-sensing-mechanisms}{%
\subsection{Sensing}\label{sec-CNT-sensing-mechanisms}}

As all atoms are at the surface of the carbon nanotube structure,
nanotubes are very sensitive to their surroundings and easily modified,
making them useful in biosensor applications
\autocite{Cao2009,Yao2021,Shkodra2021}. The chirality and diameter of a
carbon nanotube affects both its coupling with the gate and its surface
chemistry, which determines the sensing mechanisms available to a single
CNT. Only s-CNTs can be electrostatically gated; m-CNTs, bent nanotubes
and larger diameter nanotubes are typically more reactive
\autocite{Cao2009,Zhao2012,Chhikara2013,Li2023}; and the nanotube
chirality (\(n,m\)) can determine the strength of binding to DNA in a
base sequence-dependent manner \autocite{Rouhi2011a}. Carbon nanotubes
have been used for vapour-phase sensing since 2000, when Kong \emph{et
al.} found that the resistance over a single CNT channel was modified
when exposed to gas molecules like NO\(_2\) and NH\(_3\)
\autocite{Kong2000}. Carbon nanotubes have been used to detect the
presence of analyte down to the parts per billion level in a variety of
gas sensor applications \autocite{Chen2019,Yao2021}. However, in
general, the specificity of such a sensor is low, as nanotubes respond
to many different analytes in a similar manner. To enhance specificity,
surface functionalisation is often performed using either inorganic or
biological materials, such as enzymes, antibodies, aptamers and proteins
\autocite{Cao2009,Shkodra2021,Yao2021}.

For carbon nanotube network transistors, sensing mechanisms include
electrostatic gating, charge transfer, Schottky barrier modulation,
modulation of channel capacitance relative to the electrolyte and charge
scattering. Response mechanisms may take place at the gate, the
junctions between channel and contact, or at the semiconductor channel
\autocite{Heller2008,Battie2011,Boyd2014,Tran2016,Li2023}. Modification
of the channel-metal Schottky barrier can dominate sensing activity, and
this can complicate the identification of mechanisms underlying the
sensing behaviour \autocite{Cao2009,Boyd2014,Schroeder2019}. The
encapsulation layer shown in Figure~\ref{fig-gating-schematics} is added
to separate the electrodes from the channel-metal junction and prevent
these responses \autocite{Heller2008,Shkodra2021}. In an encapsulated
device, the predominant sensing mechanism is either charge transfer from
the analyte to channel \autocite{Allen2007,Battie2011} or electrostatic
gating \autocite{Heller2008}. The charge transfer mechanism involves
direct addition of charge carriers to the channel, while the gating
mechanism results from a nearby charge inducing an opposite polarity
charge in the channel. Both changes alter the relationship between
\(V_g\) and \(I_d\) and shift the carrier threshold voltage(s)
\autocite{Tran2016,Shkodra2021,Li2023}. Modulation of Schottky and other
potential barriers present in the network may also make a significant
contribution to sensing responses, especially when a network is close to
its percolation threshold \autocite{Boyd2014,Murugathas2019}.

\hypertarget{summary}{%
\section{Summary}\label{summary}}

Graphene and carbon nanotube network field-effect transistors are both
ideal as the transducer element in sensing applications due to their
excellent electrical properties and high sensitivity. These thin-film
FETs can be used as sensor platforms in either a back-gated or
liquid-gated configuration, where the liquid-gated configuration is used
in aqueous sensing applications. A key attribute of the liquid-gated
configuration is Debye length, which must be optimised for maximum
transistor sensitivity. Important device parameters of the graphene and
carbon nanotube network FETs include transconductance, on-off ratio,
gate leakage currents, current hysteresis, threshold voltage and
sub-threshold slope. The voltage corresponding to the Dirac point (or
points) of graphene is another important figure of merit for graphene
field-effect transistors. Various attributes of the morphology of
graphene and carbon nanotube networks contribute to the unique
electrical and sensing properties exhibited by these transistors,
including graphene folds and junctions between nanotubes of different
chirality. The use of these transducers in past odorant receptor
biosensor applications is discussed in \textbf{?@sec-iOR-sensors}, while
fabrication of the transducers used here is detailed in
\textbf{?@sec-fabrication}.

\subsection{General Overview}\label{general-overview}}

I started writing this thesis with one broad aim \(-\) to couple insect
odorant receptors with either a carbon nanotube or graphene field-effect
transistor for highly selective sensing in the vapour phase. Through
this process, I hoped to gain new physical insights into the transducer
and receptor elements used, through careful examination of the
biosensors which resulted from their coupling. At the end of this
investigation, three broad themes have emerged:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Slight variations in transducer morphology have a substantial impact
  on biosensor sensitivity and power consumption.
\item
  Intrinsic transducer hysteresis leads to biosensor current drift,
  which can be modelled and corrected for when interpreting sensing
  data.
\item
  Surface contamination can affect transducer functionalisation and lead
  to significant variability in biosensor quality.
\end{itemize}

These findings and their relation to the goal of creating a reliable
biosensor for a vapour-phase detection system are each detailed in this
section.

\hypertarget{biosensor-performance-and-transducer-morphology}{%
\subsection{Biosensor Performance and Transducer
Morphology}\label{biosensor-performance-and-transducer-morphology}}

Carbon nanotube networks and graphene are used as the thin-film for
sensing field-effect transistors due to their highly sensitive surface.
Features present on each film were found to enhance or reduce the
sensitivity of the transistor in a low-power configuration. The process
used for randomly depositing carbon nanotubes influences multiple
aspects of the resulting network morphology, including the density and
homogeneity of the network, the diameter of bundled carbon nanotubes,
the level of doping present and the relative proportion of metallic to
semiconducting nanotubes. These variables were investigated atomic force
microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and electrical characterisation. Devices
with carbon nanotubes deposited using surfactant in the presence of
steam were found to have relatively dense and homogeneous networks which
gave rise to highly consistent electrical characteristics, desirable for
biosensor reproducibility and multiplexing. Carbon nanotube bundle
diameters were also much smaller in these networks, which gave them a
relatively large on-off ratio and subthreshold slope, figures of merit
which correspond to low power operation. However, steam-assisted
surfactant-deposited devices were found to have significant
\(p\)-doping, possibly from surfactant. Removing the source of this
\(p\)-doping would further enhance the sensitive and low power
performance of these devices.

\hypertarget{biosensor-drift-and-transducer-hysteresis}{%
\subsection{Biosensor Drift and Transducer
Hysteresis}\label{biosensor-drift-and-transducer-hysteresis}}

All devices characterised showed a degree of hysteresis, which was
especially significant for solvent-deposited carbon nanotube network
devices as well as any device when backgated. This hysteresis is a
result of the evolving occupancy of charge traps, which are introduced
to the device by gate bias or adsorbed dopants. This changing occupancy
leads to a slow drift in current level when the transistor is operated
with constant voltages at both the drain and gate. If left until
reaching a steady state, this baseline drift can be modelled using a
linear combination of three exponentials. However, it is not feasible to
wait more than three hours for a biosensor to warm up with each use. A
series expansion was used to model the drift over a shorter period of
time, where the two longer time constant exponentials were approximated
as linear. This meant only having to wait until the first exponential
had decayed before sensing, which typically took \textless30 minutes for
a pristine, liquid-gated steam-deposited carbon nanotube device. Each
exponential term may correspond to charge traps introduced at different
stages of fabrication and functionalisation. For example, long-term
drift was consistent across channels fabricated simultaneously, but
appeared to be affected by functionalisation.

\hypertarget{biosensor-functionalisation-and-transducer-contamination}{%
\subsection{Biosensor Functionalisation and Transducer
Contamination}\label{biosensor-functionalisation-and-transducer-contamination}}

While the pristine surfactant-deposited carbon nanotube transistors were
consistently sensitive to changes in both an aqueous and vapour
environment, their selective detection ability after non-covalent
functionalisation with iORs was highly variable. Using atomic force
microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, electrical characterisation and
fluorescence microscopy it was found that the PBASE linker was
successfully attaching iOR nanodiscs to the carbon nanotube network.
While functionalisation caused significant gating of the network for
devices which were successful sensors, it was not seen for devices which
showed no selective sensing behaviour, despite the evidence that iOR
nanodiscs were present in both cases. It was therefore hypothesised that
an unknown coating on the transducer was allowing iOR nanodiscs to stick
to the network, but not form a direct electrical connection. A pristine
carbon nanotube device with such a coating could still be highly
sensitive to electrostatic or capacitive gating. However, it has
previously been noted that the primary sensing mechanism of iORs appears
to be through direct charge transfer. If an insulating coating layer is
present, it may prevent charge from passing between the iORs and the
channel.

Multiple potential candidates for this unwanted coating were identified
throughout the course of this thesis, including residual surfactant,
solvent or photoresist, multilayer or hydrolysed PBASE and hydrophobic
long-chain alkanes. Sensing experiments were then performed that
systematically eliminated possible candidates. It was found that neither
avoiding the introduction of surfactant or ensuring PBASE did not
hydrolyse led to consistent biosensors. Finally, a method was tested
that eliminated the remaining possible candidates through the use of a
oxygen plasma clean step prior to functionalisation, as well as the use
of iORs in surfactant solution with linker pre-attached. This process
resulted in a successful sensor in an aqueous environment, which is
further indication that either photoresist residue, a hydrocarbon
coating, a PBASE layer or the membrane format of iORs is the cause of
sensor variability. The impact of oxygen plasma on device mobility and
the vunerability of the unprotected iORs means that this method does
produce reliable vapour-phase sensors. A covalent,
directionally-oriented method of immobilising nanodiscs could be used
instead, which has previously been successful for vapour-phase
biosensing with mORs. Alternatively, a less destructive cleaning process
could be identified to ensure consistent non-covalent functionalisation,
used alongside a bio-friendly vapour capture layer for vapour-phase
sensing without the use of nanodiscs.

\hypertarget{sec-future-work}{%
\section{Future Work}\label{sec-future-work}}

\hypertarget{sec-future-work-fabrication}{%
\subsection{Device Fabrication and
Functionalisation}\label{sec-future-work-fabrication}}

Throughout the course of this thesis, several aspects of the fabrication
and functionalisation were identified as having potential for
improvement. Further investigation into these approaches by future
researchers could lead to improved biosensor performance and a deeper
understanding of the device physics of the sensor. The encapsulation of
device electrodes is critical for improving the performance of a device,
preventing gate leakage through the liquid-gate and avoiding modulation
of the electrode-channel Schottky barrier while sensing
\autocite{Lim2014,Albarghouthi2022,Heller2008}. Albarghouthi \emph{et
al.} outline an alternative encapsulation approach which leads to very
low gate leakage currents which could be adapted for use with our
sensing devices \autocite{Albarghouthi2022}. Here, a multilayered
encapsulation with HfO\(_2\), SU8 and PEG is used to encapsulated the
device. The only change to the existing process required is the addition
of a patterning step to leave the channel region exposed, similar to
that seen in \textbf{?@sec-encapsulation}. Furthermore, if a
nonfluorescent SU8 was used instead of SU8-2150 \autocite{Vobornik2023},
devices could be characterised with fluorescence microscopy after
encapsulation, which would be highly advantageous for verifying
functionalisation. After passivation with PEG, highly specific
attachment of fluorescence-tagged iORs could be verified in a similar
manner to that used by Lee \emph{et al.} directly prior to sensing
\autocite{Lee2012b}. If PEG passivation and linker are deposited
simultaneously, as in the approach by Filipiak \emph{et al.}
\autocite{Filipiak2018}, multiplexed fluorescence microscopy could be
used to determine the proportion of channel coverage by linker compared
with PEG passivation.

Surface contamination was identified as one of the major factors
interfering with successful device functionalisation in this thesis. To
improve the reproducibility and yield of non-covalent functionalisation
processes, and to improve device performance more generally, an
effective cleaning method needs to be identified which is able to remove
most contaminants and move the threshold voltage of devices towards 0 V.
This approach should not significantly affect the mobility of the
device. Barnett \emph{et al.} used air oxidation and annealing to remove
surfactant dopants from a carbon nanotube network, which was highly
effective at restoring the threshold voltage to 0 V
\autocite{Barnett2018}. Petkov proposed oxygen radical cleaning of
organic contaminants as an alternative to destructive oxygen plasma
cleaning, which was shown by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to
successfully remove surface hydrocarbons \autocite{Petkov2005}. Current
annealing has also proven to be an effective means of both reducing the
contact resistance of TFT devices \autocite{Schnitzspan2020} and can be
used to evaporate surface contaminants and restore threshold voltage to
0 V for both a back-gated \autocite{Ramamoorthy2018} and liquid-gated
\autocite{Kireev2017} configurations. If available to the researcher,
these techniques should all be explored to identify the most effective
and least destructive cleaning technique.

Surface contamination becomes less signficant if alternative
functionalisation methods to linker \emph{pi}-stacking are used for
functionalisation. The use of diazonium coupled with metal ion chelated
AB-NTA (N\(\alpha\),N\(\alpha\)-Bis(carboxymethyl)-L-lysine hydrate) is
known to be an effective way of covalently attaching nanodisc-held
vertebrate odorant receptors to carbon nanotubes
\autocite{Goldsmith2011}. As successful covalent binding is indicated by
a significant change in channel mobility, it becomes much easier to
distinguish between successful and unsuccessful channel
functionalisation than in the non-covalent case. Here, Cu\(^{2+}\) could
be used as the metal ion as it has a stronger binding strength than
other metal ions, such as Ni\(^{2+}\)
\autocite{Chang2017,Aravinda2009,Baur2010}. Another covalent approach
involves tethering nanodisc-held odorant receptors to gold floating
electrodes using antibody fragments
\autocite{Yang2017,Yang2018,Lee2018}. Non-covalent approaches which do
not require direct charge transfer mechanisms for sensing could also be
investigated. A similar functionalisation approach using nanovesicles
(liposomes) could be taken to that of Lim \emph{et al.}
\autocite{Lim2015}, where the Kir ion channel and hORs are replaced with
an ORCO ion channel and iORs \autocite{Wicher2021}. If ion flow occurs
within the Debye length, the resulting changes in charge could be
detected with electrostatic gating, even if no direct electrical
connection to the transducer channel exists.

\hypertarget{sec-future-work-vapour}{%
\subsection{Vapour Sensing}\label{sec-future-work-vapour}}

Further work could also be done to further improve the vapour delivery
system. This work could include changes to the system configuration
overall, as well as changes to the setup of the device in the
characterisation chamber.

The maximum flow rates of the mass flow controllers currently present in
the system are too low to carry some of the volatile compounds of
interest for testing with the iORs. For example, the vapour pressure of
methyl salicylate, agonist for OR10a, was found to be too low to be
successfully delivered by the existing vapour delivery system
\autocite{MeSal}. All three mass controllers could be replaced two MFCs
which have an identical maximum flow of either 1000 or 10000 sccm. This
may require the PVC tubing to be replaced with stainless steel to cope
with higher pressures, with check valves added to avoid the system being
over-pressurised. These two MFCs could be operated in the manner
outlined by Goldsmith \emph{et al.} for a constant and uninterrupted
flow of nitrogen \autocite{Goldsmith2011}. In this setup, the first MFC
maintains a constant flow rate through the dilution line at all times
during a sensing experiment. The second MFC is also kept at a constant
flow rate at all times, but feeds into a computer-automated solenoid
valve which is able to switch the flow between the dilution and carrier
line. The second MFC is then only directed through the carrier line
during the relevant intervals of a sensing series.

Exposing iORs to vapour-phase compounds outside of a protective lipid
membrane environment may cause them significant damage
\autocite{Sato2014,Warden2019}. A capture layer can be used to mimic the
mucus within the insect sensillum lymph, which protects the dendrite
cells \emph{in vivo} \autocite{Shkodra2021,Sato2014,Hurot2020,Cali2020}.
A variety of possible capture layer solutions for vapour-phase
field-effect transistor sensors can be found in the literature. Lee
\emph{et al.} and Kuznetsov \emph{et al.} integrated an aqueous membrane
held by polycarbonate and SiO\(_2\)/Si\(_3\)N\(_4\)/SiO\(_2\) into their
sensor, which prevented electrolyte evaporation
\autocite{Lee2015,Kuznetsov2018}. Bio-gels or ionic liquids (ILs) are
other potential candidates for mucus-like capture layers. Sato \emph{et
al.} and Hirata \emph{et al.} used an agarose hydrogel in a microchamber
array as a capture layer \autocite{Sato2014,Hirata2021}. Ionic liquids
have low vapour pressure, high capacitance, as well as high
electrochemical stability. Both 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium
bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl imide (BMIM) \autocite{Hwang2014,White2015}
and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIM)
\autocite{Inaba2014,Kiga2012} have been used as the electrolytic gate
for thin-film field-effect transistors. However, alternative ionic
liquid candidates may need to be identified which are compatible with
the biological elements of the sensor \autocite{Gomes2019,Shukla2020}.
Ionic liquids also show a degree of selectivity towards volatile
compounds, which needs to be accounted for when used as a capture layer
\autocite{Kulkarni2007}.

The capture layer could also be used as a liquid-gate to maximise device
sensitivity. A gate electrode can be photolithographically patterned
onto the device surface alongside the source and drain electrodes for
this purpose, making contact with the capture layer through an
additional gap in the device encapsulation \autocite{Shkodra2021}. Only
slight alterations would have to be made to the device design outlined
in this thesis for implementation. A potential difficulty with this
approach might be ensuring rapid odorant diffusion through the layer to
the iOR-FET surface, especially when compounds are insoluble
\autocite{Yamada2021,Hurot2020,Warden2019,Cali2020,Lee2015,Spencer2021}.
Yamada \emph{et al.} used hydrophobic microslits at the liquid-vapour
interface to promote mixing of compounds within an aqueous environment
\autocite{Yamada2021}. It may also be possible to use odorant binding
proteins to carry volatile compounds to the odorant receptors, which is
how volatiles are carried from the surface of the sensillum and through
the mucus membrane to the odorant receptors \emph{in vivo}
\autocite{Larisika2015,Kotlowski2018,Brito2016,Cali2020,Pelosi2018,Sankaran2011}.

\hypertarget{multiplexing}{%
\subsection{Multiplexing}\label{multiplexing}}

A scent in nature contains a mixture of many different volatile organic
compounds in vapour at different concentrations. A future vapour-phase
iOR biosensor should therefore be able to perform multiplexed
measurements with different iORs in different channels, to
simultaneously measure and distinguish between mixtures of volatile
organic compounds \autocite{Kwon2015,Hurot2020,Hirata2021}. A similar
approach could be taken to that of Kwon \emph{et al.} and Son \emph{et
al.}, but for insect odorant receptors \autocite{Kwon2015,Son2017}. Care
should be taken to avoid the coffee-ring effect when functionalising
individual channels of a device (\textbf{?@sec-coffee-ring}). The use of
small, deep microchannels in clean PDMS, which keep functionalisation
material close to the channel, may be essential for consistent
functionalisation. A difficulty that could arise when multiplexing is
that iORs can specifically bind with multiple VOCs. When interacting
with an iOR, different volatiles can `antagonise' each other; some iORs
will not respond to a positive ligand if another specific ligand is
present \autocite{Kwon2015,Son2017,Munch2016,Hirata2021}. This means a
multiplexed iOR biosensor would first need to be tested individually
against different volatile compounds, and then with mixtures of volatile
compounds to detect any antagonistic behaviours in a systematic manner.

delivery system device. Source electrode terminals are labelled S, drain
electrode terminals are labelled D, the gate electrode terminal is

\end{figure}

This thesis used an existing setup for aqueous sensing which could
already be used for eight-channel multiplexed measurements. For the
vapour delivery system chamber, it is already possible to connect four
channels at once through a custom breakout board, shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-vapour-sensor-breakout}. Both setups should be
sufficient for testing three iOR-functionalised channels simultaneously
alongside an empty iOR-functionalised channel. To switch between
analytes in a single vapour-phase sensing run with uninterrupted flow, a
second analyte bottle could be installed which branches off from the
existing carrier line. A solenoid-controlled 4-way valve could be placed
after these analyte bottles, which runs the vapour flow from one analyte
bottle to the exhaust and one into chamber at all times, as illustrated
in Figure~\ref{fig-vapour-sensor-multiplexing}. In this way, the amount
of flow passing into the chamber is largely unchanged across a sensing
run. An advantage of this setup is that each carrier line only ever
contains one analyte to prevent cross-contamination between lines. For
multiplexing with more than two analytes, more analyte bottles could be
added and a 16-way or 32-way valve used.

\section{Raman Spectroscopy Analysis}\label{sec-raman-analysis}}

The purpose of this code is to analyse a series of Raman spectra taken
at different points on a single film (see
\textbf{?@sec-raman-characterisation}). Data is imported in a series of
tab-delimited text files, with the low wavenumber spectrum (100
cm\(^{-1} - 650\) cm\(^{-1}\)) and high wavenumber spectrum (1300
cm\(^{-1} - 1650\) cm\(^{-1}\)) imported in separate datafiles for each
scan location.

\section{Field-Effect Transistor
Analysis}\label{sec-field-effect-transistor-analysis}}

The purpose of this code is to analyse electrical measurements taken of
field-effect transistor (FET) devices. Electrical measurements were
either taken from the Keysight 4156C Semiconductor Parameter Analyser,
National Instruments NI-PXIe or Keysight B1500A Semiconductor Device
Analyser as discussed in \textbf{?@sec-electrical-characterisation}; the
code is able to analyse data in .csv format taken from all three
measurement setups. The main Python file in the code base consists of
three related but independent modules: the first analyses and plots
sensing data from the FET devices, the second analyses and plots
transfer characteristics from channels across a device, and the third
compares individual channel characteristics before and after a
modification or after each of several modifications. The code base also
features a separate config file and style sheet which govern the
behaviour of the main code. The code base was designed collaboratively
by myself and Erica Cassie over GitHub using the Sourcetree Git GUI.
