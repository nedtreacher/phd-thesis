The ability to detect volatile organic compounds in a highly sensitive and selective manner is desirable for a variety of different applications, including diagnosing illnesses at a remote clinic, monitoring air in an industrial workplace, or identifying biomarkers from invasive organisms at a biosecurity checkpoint. This thesis therefore investigates the coupling of insect odorant receptors (iORs) with carbon nanotube network field-effect transistors (CNT FETs) and graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) to create a sensitive and selective vapour-phase sensor or ‘bioelectronic nose’. \\[5pt] The properties of three distinct carbon nanotube network morphologies were compared to understand their relative suitability as transducer thin films for the bioelectronic nose. The first morphology was obtained by depositing ultrasonicated carbon nanotubes in solvent, the second by depositing carbon nanotubes in surfactant solution, and the third by depositing with surfactant in the presence of steam. Compared to the other morphologies used, the steam-assisted deposition devices were found to have highly consistent device-to-device electrical properties due to their relatively low bundling and dense coverage of the substrate (>70\%). The steam-assisted deposition devices, however, were found to be more highly \textit{p}-doped than the other morphologies, with a relatively large liquid-gated threshold voltage (0.37 V). The sensitivity of the transducer was verified using an aqueous phosphate buffered saline (PBS) dilution series which followed a logarithmic trend. To account for baseline drift due to hysteresis, the device was left at a constant voltage for 30 minutes before the dilution series. By allowing baseline drift to settle over this period, it could be reasonably approximated as linear, estimated using a linear fit and removed from the data. \\[5pt] A vapour delivery system was also adapted for the purpose of testing the bioelectronic nose in a vapour environment. A photoionisation detector (PID) and a relative humidity and temperature indicator (RHI) were added to the existing system, which could be used to non-selectively detect vapours for comparison with measurements taken by the bioelectronic nose. Two new mass flow controllers (MFCs) were also added to the system to allow for a greater range of flow rates. A new electronic control system was also created to integrate the new MFCs and RHI. In the upgraded vapour delivery system, MFC-controlled nitrogen flow bubbles through analyte, carrying vapour into a device characterisation chamber, and then into a manifold leading to the PID and RHI. A steam-assisted deposition CNT FET was found to be sensitive to ppb concentrations of ethyl hexanoate (EtHex) and \textit{trans}-2-hexen-1-al (E2Hex). Baseline drift from hysteresis was found to be significantly larger when backgated in the vapour delivery system, and a 40 minute period was therefore used when waiting for baseline drift to settle. \\[5pt] One of the major challenges encountered in this thesis was the variability in quality of the non-covalent functionalisation method used. 1-pyrenebutanoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (PBASE) was primarily used as a linker molecule to attach the iORs to carbon nanotubes and graphene. This linker is widely used in the literature, but there is little agreement on the optimal process variables to use. It was verified that PBASE and iOR nanodiscs were successfully attaching to the transistor channel with a method previously used for iOR functionalisation. However, devices functionalised in an identical manner would rarely operate as expected and usually showed no sensing activity. It was found that devices which showed no sensing activity also exhibited no change in transfer characteristics after functionalisation, despite iOR nanodiscs being present. A possible explanation for this behaviour is the presence of a contamination layer which electrically isolates iOR nanodiscs from the transducer material. A device functionalised with pyrene-PEG-biotin (PPB) and avi-tagged OR10a after the use of a destructive oxygen plasma cleaning step responded to low fM concentrations of methyl salicylate (MeSal), further supporting this hypothesis. It was concluded that successful and reproducible vapour sensing using non-covalent functionalisation may require a robust, non-destructive cleaning method for the transducer platform.

\section{Background}\label{background}}

The `bioelectronic nose', an electronic transducer modified with
elements of the animal olfactory system, has the potential to allow
specific detection of airborne volatile compounds at concentrations as
low as parts per trillion
\autocite{Glatz2011,Kwon2015,Dung2018,Kim2022a}. An ideal transducer
platform is the thin-film transistor (TFT) which is particularly
portable, simple to use, small and robust
\autocite{Kauffman2008,Khan2020}. The thin films used in these
field-effect transistors (FETs) include carbon nanotube networks and
graphene, low-dimensional nanomaterials which are both highly sensitive
and biocompatible \autocite{Shkodra2021}. The implications of successful
development of such a portable and robust bioelectronic nose are
significant. Applications could be found in high-importance fields such
as biosecurity, medicine, environmental protection and food safety
\autocite{Dung2018,Arakawa2019,Yang2017,Son2017}. For example, it has
been demonstrated that it is possible to detect invasive brown
marmorated stinkbugs based on their volatile trace \autocite{Moser2020}.
A bioelectronic nose could potentially accomplish this biosecurity task
far more cheaply and efficiently than trained sniffer dogs
\autocite{Lee2010,Moon2020,Terutsuki2020}. There has been rapid progress
in the development of bioelectronic noses using carbon nanotube
field-effect transistors (CNT FETs) and graphene field-effect
transistors (GFETs) over the past 15-20 years
\autocite{Yoon2009,Lee2010,Yang2018}.

Insect odorant receptors (iORs) enable simple invertebrates, such as the
vinegar fruit fly \emph{Drosophila melanogaster}, to distinguish between
a huge number of specific volatile compounds
\autocite{Hallem2004,Smart2008,Wicher2008,Munch2016,Bohbot2020}. Within
the past five years, a variety of \emph{Drosophila melanogaster} iORs
have been successfully coupled with highly sensitive low-dimensional
thin-film transistors (TFTs) for specific detection of fruit-like odors
in an aqueous environment \autocite{Murugathas2019a,Murugathas2020}.
iORs have also been used for sensitive and selective volatile detection
in a lipid bilayer format, but not in a portable bioelectronic nose
format \autocite{Yamada2021}. In this thesis, my aim was to investigate
whether a bioelectronic nose capable of odorant detection in a
vapour-phase environment could be constructed by coupling iORs with
TFTs. Alongside practical applications, development of a vapour-phase
bioelectronic nose using iORs may give us a greater understanding of the
mechanisms underlying insect olfaction \autocite{Lee2010}. The
transduction mechanism of nanomaterial-based iOR sensors is still
unknown, and I hope to shed further light on the biological and
electronic processes underpinning this mechanism
\autocite{Murugathas2020,Khadka2019,Cheema2021}.

\section{Thesis Outline}\label{thesis-outline}}

This thesis consists of nine chapters. The first three chapters,
including this one, are background chapters introducing the general
topics of this thesis. The fourth and fifth chapters are methods
chapters, while the next three chapters (sixth, seventh and eight)
describe the results obtained. The ninth chapter concludes the thesis
and discusses possible next steps for future research.

\textbf{Chapter 2} gives a broad description of carbon nanotube and
graphene field-effect transistors with a focus on their use in sensing
applications. The chapter begins by looking at the general structure and
properties of thin-film transistors, where key figures of merit such as
transconductance, on-off ratio, gate current and hysteresis are
described. Graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) and carbon nanotube
network field-effect transistors (CNT FETs) are then discussed in
greater detail. These descriptions include the chemical composition of
each nanomaterial, their conduction behaviour and their unique sensor
properties when integrated into a field-effect transistor as a
thin-film.

\textbf{Chapter 3} investigates existing odorant receptor-coupled
thin-film field-effect transistors in the literature. First, the
biological structure of odorant receptors and membrane formats for their
protection in vitro are discussed. Details are then provided regarding
the construction and operation of existing vertebrate odorant receptor
TFT biosensors. The structure and function of the insect odorant
receptor is then contrasted with the vertebrate odorant receptor, and
existing insect odorant receptor TFT biosensors in the literature are
discussed. The chapter finishes with a brief discussion of non-specific
binding and its role in hindering biosensor activity.

\textbf{Chapter 4} describes the fabrication of the CNT FET and GFET
transducers used in this thesis and the characterisation techniques used
to probe their behaviour. The chapter starts with an introduction to
photolithography for thin-film transistor device fabrication. Various
techniques are described for random deposition of carbon nanotube
networks to act as channels for these thin-film transistors.
Characterisation techniques described in this chapter include atomic
force microscopy (AFM), fluorescence microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and
electrical characterisation with various semiconductor device analysers.

\textbf{Chapter 5} outlines the development of a vapour delivery system
for characterisation of the insect odorant receptor functionalised TFT
biosensors in a vapour-phase environment. The vapour delivery system was
upgraded from an existing system to include new mass flow controllers,
to have greater control of flow through the system, and off the shelf
vapour sensors, to collect vapour flow data that could be used for
comparison against biosensor activity. The chapter also describes the
design and construction of an electronic interface to monitor and
control the components of the vapour delivery system. The flow rate
through the system was then calibrated and reference sensors tested.

\textbf{Chapter 6} presents the results obtained from the use of
characterisation techniques on the pristine GFETs and CNT FETs. Various
carbon nanotube (CNT) network morphologies are displayed and analysed.
The Raman spectra and electrical device parameters of these CNT network
morphologies are then discussed, along with electrical parameters from
graphene devices. The sensitivity of a dense CNT network morphology
device is then tested in both the aqueous and vapour-phase.

\textbf{Chapter 7} explores the non-covalent functionalisation of GFETs
and CNT FETs with various linker molecules for insect odorant receptor
attachment. The linker molecules tested were 1-pyrenebutanoic acid
N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (PBASE) and 1-pyrenebutyric acid (PBA) with
1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC). Pyrene-NTA and
pyrene-biotin were also investigated as other possible linker molecules.
The quality of various functionalisation approaches was then explored
with various fluorescently-tagged linker molecules and biomolecules. In
this process, various potential obstacles to successful biosensor
functionalisation were identified.

\textbf{Chapter 8} details progress made towards the creation of an
insect odorant receptor functionalised TFT biosensor for use in a
vapour-phase environment. Two different approaches are described that
gave rise to working aqueous-phase biosensors. The first
functionalisation approach, which used PBASE in methanol, led to
irreproducible results when biosensing. Possible factors causing the
unreliability of this method were then investigated. A second approach
was then designed to avoid the malign influence of any identified
factors. Biosensors functionalised using this approach were then tested
in a vapour-phase environment.

\textbf{Chapter 9} summarises the conclusions drawn from this work, and
proposes various related studies which can be undertaken to continue the
work described in this thesis.

\section{Field-Effect Transistor
Analysis}\label{sec-field-effect-transistor-analysis}}

The purpose of this code is to analyse electrical measurements taken of
field-effect transistor (FET) devices. Electrical measurements were
either taken from the Keysight 4156C Semiconductor Parameter Analyser,
National Instruments NI-PXIe or Keysight B1500A Semiconductor Device
Analyser as discussed in \textbf{?@sec-electrical-characterisation}; the
code is able to analyse data in .csv format taken from all three
measurement setups. The main Python file in the code base consists of
three related but independent modules: the first analyses and plots
sensing data from the FET devices, the second analyses and plots
transfer characteristics from channels across a device, and the third
compares individual channel characteristics before and after a
modification or after each of several modifications. The code base also
features a separate config file and style sheet which govern the
behaviour of the main code. The code base was designed collaboratively
by myself and Erica Cassie over GitHub using the Sourcetree Git GUI.
