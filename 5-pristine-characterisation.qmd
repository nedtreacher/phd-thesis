#	Characteristics of Pristine Carbon Nanotube & Graphene Field Effect Transistors

##	Carbon Nanotube Network Morphology {#sec-pristine-morphology}

@fig-afm-morphology shows a side-by-side comparison of the surface morphology of carbon nanotube films fabricated using the methods described in @sec-dep-carbon-nanotubes. These images were collected using an atomic force microscope and processed in the manner described in @sec-afm-characterisation. They each show bundles of carbon nanotubes with a range of diameters and lengths, with each bundle containing one or multiple nanotubes. As discussed in previous works using solvent-based deposition techniques for depositing carbon nanotubes, multi-tube bundles form due to strong mutual attraction between nanotubes [@Zheng2017; @Thanihaichelvan2018; @Thanihaichelvan2019; @Nguyen2021]. However, when surfactants are present, they adsorb onto the carbon nanotubes and form a highly repulsive structure able to overcome the strong attraction between nanotubes. This repulsion then keeps the individual carbon nanotubes isolated [@Wenseleers2004; @Shimizu2013]. The diameter range provided by the supplier for the individual carbon nanotubes used is $1.2-1.7$ nm, while the length range is $0.3-5.0$ $\mu$m (Nanointegris).

2.5 $\mu$m $\times$ 2.5 $\mu$m atomic force microscope (AFM) images of carbon nanotube films deposited using various methods, shown side-by-side with surface profile histograms extracted from the AFM profile. Each histogram is shown alongside a linear combination of normal distributions #1 and #2, corresponding to the silicon and carbon nanotube distribution respectively. The counts remaining after #1 and #2 have been subtracted from the AFM histogram are shown in blue.
:::

The diameter range of deposited single-walled carbon nanotubes can be modelled via a normal or Gaussian distribution [@Thanihaichelvan2018; @Liu2013; @Vobornik2023]. However, when we extract and bin the height profiles from the 2.5 $\mu$m $\times$ 2.5 $\mu$m AFM images, plotted in black in @fig-afm-morphology, the histograms do not follow a normal distribution. The reason for this result is that the carbon nanotubes do not lie perfectly level on a perfectly level silicon oxide substrate - the atomic force microscope histogram would only be a single normal distribution in this ideal case. In practice, the SiO$_2$ substrate and carbon nanotube surface both have a degree of roughness, which may in part be due to the presence of atmospheric contaminants. In the case of the surfactant-deposited networks, residual surfactant may also contribute to surface roughness [@Vobornik2023]. Furthermore, nanotubes overlap and cross over each other, creating junctions with the combined height of the overlapping nanotubes.

It has been demonstrated that the surface roughness of a bare SiO$_2$ substrate can also be modelled with a normal distribution. This normal distribution can be set as the reference or zero point for other height measurements [@Velicky2015]. As both the carbon nanotube and silicon dioxide background heights can each be modelled using a normal distribution, we make an initial assumption that a linear combination of normal distributions can be used to model the AFM histograms in @fig-afm-morphology. Using the process discussed in @sec-histogram-analysis, we approximate the normal distributions corresponding to the silicon oxide substrate and carbon nanotube network, shown in @fig-afm-morphology as green and red curves respectively. The silicon oxide peak appears to fit more closely to the distribution with smaller carbon nanotube heights, which could be due to measurement of the silicon background being improved when feature height is smaller. We notice that the distribution for the carbon nanotube bundles drops to approximately zero before reaching 0 nm, which is physically appropriate.

:::

By subtracting the modelled silicon and carbon nanotube normal distributions from the AFM histogram, we find a remaining distribution spread roughly between 0 nm and the mean of the carbon nanotube bundle distribution. Interestingly, the peak of the carbon nanotube distribution occurs at a height approximately 2.5$\times$ the height corresponding to the peak of the remaining distribution. It is also apparent that the remaining distribution consistently follows a normal distribution after a sharp rise to maximum, as shown in @fig-remaining-histogram. This distribution appears to correspond to surface roughness due to the presence of contaminants, or possibly to broken pieces of individual nanotubes with various lengths.Contaminants could be residual surfactant or other atmospheric contamination resistant to acetone and isopropanol rinsing. Such contamination may or may not have implications for biosensing suitability, but surfactant contamination could certainly have negative effects on biological elements sensitive to surfactant. The area of this central peak may be useful for determining the extent of contamination on a carbon nanotube film, discussed further in @sec-contamination.

If we model carbon nanotube bundles as cylinders, and we assume the component nanotubes follow 2D packing and are of equal diameter, we can give an estimate the mean bundle size for each deposition type in terms of number of nanotubes *n* [@Graham1998; @Thanihaichelvan2018; @Specht2023].

```

@tbl-circle-packing shows the relationship between the diameter of a bundle and the constituent diameters of up to nine 2D packed carbon nanotubes within that bundle. Assuming an average carbon nanotube diameter of 1.45 $\pm$ 0.13 nm, we can use the $d$/$d_n$ packing ratios to obtain an estimate of the number of nanotubes in the mean bundle size for each deposition [@Specht2023]. These estimates are shown in @tbl-histogram-parameters. Also shown is an estimate of the ratio of single- to multi-tube bundles for each deposition, found by comparing the proportion of each carbon nanotube curve below and above 2.9 nm, the minimum multi-tube bundle size for 1.45 nm diameter nanotubes.

When surfactant is used in the deposition process, both the carbon nanotube bundle diameter mean and standard deviation are small compared to the mean and standard deviation of solvent deposited films. However, despite the presence of surfactant, it is apparent both from @fig-afm-morphology and @tbl-histogram-parameters that not all surfactant-dispersed carbon nanotubes are deposited individually. Bundling may occur during the process of deposition onto the substrate, which could disrupt the repulsive forces from the surfactant coating and allow attractive forces to temporarily dominate. 

It is possible that the bundling of surfactant-dispersed carbon nanotubes occurs due to the coffee-ring effect [@Deegan1997; @VanGaalen2021]. The coffee-ring effect refers to a build-up of dispersed solid forming around the edges of a dispersion evaporating on a surface. This process occurs due to the dispersion edges being fixed by surface forces, leading to capillary flow outwards to replace liquid evaporating at the edges, bringing solid material along with it. The presence of vapour is known to disrupt this effect [@Bishop2020].

Transfer characteristics of carbon nanotube networks deposited using various methods. 1XPBS was used as the buffer for the liquid-gated measurements here. The source-drain voltage used for all sweeps was $V_{ds} = 100 \textrm{mV}$. A step size of 20 mV was used for the liquid-gated sweeps, while a step size of 100 mV was used for the backgated sweeps. Each sweep was taken from a separate device. Devices with a 100 nm SiO$_2$ layer were used for backgated measurements, and devices with a 300 nm SiO$_2$ layer were used for liquid gated measurements.
:::

Each carbon nanotube device fabricated was electrically characterised as described in @sec-electrical-characterisation, and electrical data was analysed using the Python code discussed in @sec-field-effect-transistor-analysis. 

Figure @fig-pristine-cnt-characteristics displays multi-channel measurements of representative devices fabricated as described in @sec-fabrication. To ensure a consistent comparison, each device here was encapsulated with AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 encapsulation before measurements were taken. The channels which did not exhibit reliable transistor characteristics are not shown. These 'non-working' channels were either shorted, due to metal remaining on the channel after lift-off, or were very low current, due to a very sparse carbon nanotube network. Devices shown here with a solvent-deposited carbon nanotube network were fabricated prior to Jan 2022; devices with a surfactant-deposited network without steam present were fabricated prior to Jun 2021; devices with a surfactant-deposited network without steam were fabricated prior to Sep 2022.

When backgated, devices exhibited *p*-type transistor behaviour with significant hysteresis and negligible gate current leakage. The devices fabricated with a solvent-based deposition were switched off at a lower voltage than the devices which used surfactant during deposition.

When the devices were liquid-gated with 1XPBS electrolyte buffer, they exhibited ambipolar characteristics, commonly observed in carbon nanotube network FETs [@Kauffman2008; @Heller2009; @JongYu2009; @Derenskyi2014; @Thanihaichelvan2018; @Albarghouthi2022]. Devices generally exhibited significantly less hysteresis than in the backgated case. When devices were appropriately configured, leakage current did not exceed $\sim 1 \times 10^-7$ V across the sweep. The devices which used carbon nanotube films deposited in surfactant with steam present had significantly less channel-to-channel variation in electrical characteristics than the devices fabricated using other approaches. The consistent channel-to-channel electrical properties of these steam-deposited devices matches the consistent morphology of the films used to make them, as seen in @sec-pristine-morphology. Being able to achieve consistent subthreshold regime behaviour between channels on the same device is a desirable attribute for reliable real-time multiplexed biosensing.

A summary of key parameters of pristine liquid-gated devices is shown in @fig-sweep-parameters. The full dataset consists of three sets of 21 liquid-gated transfer characteristics of working channels, with each set corresponding to the use of a particular method of carbon nanotube network deposition in the device fabrication. Measurements from at least three devices are included in each set. Channels from surfactant-deposited film devices usually showed a larger on-off ratio and subthreshold slope than those from solvent-deposited devices. When the transistor is gated in the subthreshold range, a larger on-off ratio and subthreshold slope results in a larger change in conductance in response to changes in the transfer characteristic curve. Therefore, a larger on-off ratio and subthreshold slope is desirable for improved sensor performance [@Kauffman2008; @Heller2009]. The larger on-off ratio and subthreshold slope is likely a result of the reduced bundling discussed in @sec-pristine-morphology. Carbon nanotube pathways across the channel with a lower degree of bundling will have a lower number of component metallic tubes,  [@Thanihaichelvan2018].

When steam is used for surfactant deposition of films, the resulting devices showed much more consistent 
All channels characterised had a positive threshold voltage. The threshold voltage was largest and most consistent for steam-assisted surfactant-deposited films.

These boxplots illustrate the statistical distribution of (a) the on-off ratio, (b) the threshold voltage and (c) the subthreshold slope of liquid-gated transistor channels corresponding to each type of carbon nanotube film deposition. For each deposition type, measurements were taken from 21 channels of at least three separate devices. The boxes indicate the 25th and 75th percentile of the distribution.
