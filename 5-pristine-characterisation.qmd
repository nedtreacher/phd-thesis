#	Characteristics of Pristine Carbon Nanotube & Graphene Field Effect Transistors

## Introduction

A range of methods were followed to fabricate carbon nanotube network and graphene field-effect transistors for biosensor use. This chapter therefore looks to use the characterisation techniques outlined in the previous chapter to compare and contrast the device channel morphologies and electrical characteristics resulting from various methods.

The three carbon nanotube film types used for devices were the solvent-deposited, surfactant-deposited and steam-assisted surfactant-deposited (steam-deposited) films discussed in the previous chapter. As minor changes were made to fabrication processes throughout the thesis, the fabrication dates of devices used are stated, which can be cross-referenced with @sec-fabrication to identify the specific process used. Atomic force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy was performed on the carbon nanotube networks to identify the distribution of carbon nanotube diameters and the defects present on the carbon nanotube networks. Electrical characterisation was then used to see how the morphology of each film type affects the performance of the completed devices. Both back-gated and liquid-gated transfer characteristics were compared, as well as key parameters taken from the liquid-gated characteristics. The electrical behaviour of liquid-gated graphene devices was also examined, as well as the impact of water on the performance of back-gated devices for vapour sensing use.

Finally, as a control measurement for liquid-gated sensing and to verify the behaviour of the pristine device as a sensor, a salt concentration sensing series was performed with a steam-deposited carbon nanotube network device. The device characteristics were taken and device drift was examined and modelled. The sensing series was performed by successively diluting 1XPBS electrolyte in the polydimethylsiloxane 'well' (electrolyte container) while passing a current through the device, and measuring the current response to dilutions. Various filters were applied to the collected data to better understand the signal change.

##	Carbon Nanotube Network Morphology and Composition {#sec-pristine-morphology}

### Atomic Force Microscopy {#sec-pristine-AFM}

@fig-afm-morphology shows a side-by-side comparison of the surface morphology of carbon nanotube films fabricated using the methods described in @sec-dep-carbon-nanotubes. These images were collected using an atomic force microscope and processed in the manner described in @sec-afm-characterisation. @fig-bundled-network shows a film of carbon nanotubes deposited in solvent, @fig-dropcast-network shows a film of carbon nanotubes dropcast in surfactant, and @fig-steaming-network shows carbon nanotubes dropcast in surfactant in the presence of steam. As discussed in previous works using solvent-based deposition techniques for depositing carbon nanotubes, in each network multi-tube bundles form due to strong mutual attraction between nanotubes [@Zheng2017; @Murugathas2018; @Murugathas2019a; @Nguyen2021]. However, when surfactants are present, they adsorb onto the carbon nanotubes and form a highly repulsive structure able to overcome the strong attraction between nanotubes. This repulsion keeps the individual carbon nanotubes more isolated [@Wenseleers2004; @Gavrel2013; @Hermanson2013-16; @Shimizu2013; @DiCrescenzo2014]. The diameter range provided by the supplier for the individual carbon nanotubes used is $1.2-1.7$ nm, while the length range is $0.3-5.0$ $\mu$m (Nanointegris).

It has previously been demonstrated that the diameter range of deposited single-walled carbon nanotubes can be modelled via a normal or Gaussian distribution [@LeMieux2008; @Liu2013; @Vobornik2023]. However, when the height profiles from the 2.5 $\mu$m $\times$ 2.5 $\mu$m AFM images are directly extracted and binned, as plotted in black in @fig-afm-morphology, the histograms obtained do not follow a normal distribution. One reason for this result is the surface roughness of the silicon dioxide substrate. The carbon nanotubes do not lie perfectly level on a perfectly level silicon oxide substrate. In practice, both the SiO$_2$ substrate and the surface of the carbon nanotubes both have a degree of roughness. To find the contribution of surface roughness to the height profile histogram corresponding to each network deposition method, silicon dioxide substrates were modified using the same processes as in @fig-afm-morphology but without carbon nanotubes present in the solutions used. 2.5 $\mu$m $\times$ 2.5 $\mu$m AFM images of the modified surfaces are shown in @fig-afm-substrate.

:::

In @fig-afm-substrate, it appears that each substrate surface has a roughness that follows a normal distribution with some degree of skewness. @fig-sio2-histogram and @fig-surfactant-histogram are negatively skewed distributions. The fitted skew-normal distribution in @fig-sio2-histogram has a skew parameter $\alpha$ (or shape parameter) of -3.2, a location parameter $\xi$ of 2.2 nm and a scale parameter $\omega$ of 0.5 nm, while in @fig-surfactant-histogram $\alpha = -2.2$, $\xi = 2.2$ nm and $\omega = 0.5$ nm. $\xi$ and $\omega$ correspond to the mean and standard deviation of the skew-free normal distribution when $\alpha$ is set equal to zero [@Azzalini1999]. The close correspondence between $\xi$ and $\omega$ for these distributions but not $\alpha$ implies that the skewness is a variable imaging or processing artifact rather than a physical property of the surface. Without distortion, the roughness of a clean SiO$_2$ surface should follow a normal distribution [@Velicky2015].

However, @fig-steamed-surfactant-histogram has a pronounced positive skew with a long tail. The tail appears to result from the contribution of residual surfactant aggregates to surface morphology, observed in @fig-steamed-surfactant and recently discussed elsewhere in the literature [@Christensen2022; @Vobornik2023]. Attempting to fit a skew-normal distribution to this histogram fails when all three variables are allowed to vary due to the presence of the tail. Instead, previous values obtained for $\xi$ and $\omega$ can be used for the fitting process, with only $\alpha$ allowed to change. Fixing $\xi$ and $\omega$ at 2.2 nm and 0.5 nm respectively gives the result shown in @fig-steamed-surfactant-histogram. The fitted distribution has an $\alpha$ of -2.4. The distribution closely fits the negative tail of the histogram, but deviates slightly from the positive tail due to the presence of surfactant. Since this deviation is small, the quality of the fit is still reasonably high, with an R-squared value of 0.98. Surfactant contamination could have negative effects on both sensitivity of carbon nanotubes and also could damage attached biological elements.

An masked AFM image is shown in (a), where the masked carbon nanotube bundles are shaded blue. The mask sets a height threshold so that masked features are excluded from the height dataset. Histogram height distributions with corresponding KDE plots collected via the morphology analysis method outlined by Vobornik *et al.* [@Vobornik2023] are shown in (b)-(d). The substrate in (b) was exposed to solvent, the substrate in (c) was exposed to surfactant, and the substrate in (d) was exposed to surfactant with steam present.
:::

Using the morphology analysis technique outlined by Vobornik *et al.* [@Vobornik2023], five successive diameter measurements of 30 carbon nanotube bundles were collected using Gwyddion. Measurements were not taken at bundle junctions. A height threshold 'mask' was defined in Gwyddion to determine average substrate height, as shown in @fig-mask. This background value was subtracted from our diameter measurements to determine the actual bundle height. The means of the solvent-deposited, surfactant-deposited and steam-assisted surfactant-deposited bundle diameter histograms are $8.8 \pm 4.0$ nm, $4.2 \pm 1.8$ nm and $3.3 \pm 1.0$ nm respectively. An increased maximum feature height leads to an increased mean background height, and by examining the AFM images in @fig-afm-morphology it appears this may be due to deep artifacts on the surface of the substrate in the vicinity of large features. The average of the five height-adjusted values for each carbon nanotube bundle was then calculated, and these 30 averages were sorted into six equal-sized bins. The binned bundle diameter measurements, alongside estimated probability density, are shown in @fig-cnt-histogram. 

From @fig-cnt-histogram, it is clear that each histogram appears to follow a positively skewed normal distribution, different to the skew-free normal distribution expected from previous works [@LeMieux2008; @Liu2013;  @Vobornik2023]. The skew is likely another artifact from imaging the network with the atomic force microscope. The force of the atomic force microscope tip is known to cause larger bundles to undergo some degree of compression, and the resulting systematic underestimation of their height may be responsible for the distribution skewness [@Vobornik2023]. The fitted skew-normal distribution in @fig-solvent-cnt-histogram has $\alpha = 2.7$, $\xi = 4.3$ nm, $\omega = 5.9$ nm, the distribution in @fig-surfactant-cnt-histogram has $\alpha = 2.4$, $\xi = 2.2$ nm, $\omega = 2.6$ nm, and the distribution in @fig-steamed-surfactant-cnt-histogram has $\alpha = 3.6$, $\xi = 2.2$ nm and $\omega = 1.5$ nm. The probability density for the carbon nanotube bundle histogram drops to approximately zero at or before 0 nm, which is physically appropriate.

Previously, analysis of the morphology of carbon nanotube networks has been simplified by assuming the component nanotubes are cylinders, follow 2D packing and are of equal diameter [@Murugathas2018]. @tbl-circle-packing shows the relationship between the diameter of a bundle of 2D packed cylinders and the constituent diameters of up to nine cylinders within that bundle. From looking up the relevant $d$/$d_n$ packing ratios, and assuming an average carbon nanotube diameter of 1.45 nm, it is possible to use  to find the approximate number of nanotubes *n* likely to be present in the mean bundle size corresponding to each deposition type [@Graham1998; @Specht2023].  These estimates are shown in @tbl-histogram-parameters. Also shown in @tbl-histogram-parameters is an estimate of the ratio of single- to multi-tube bundles for each deposition. This estimate was obtained by taking the integral of each distribution with a lower bound of 2.9 nm, the minimum multi-tube bundle size for 1.45 nm diameter nanotubes. As the area under the curve represents the probability a bundle will have a particular diameter, this integral should give a good estimate of the relative proportion of multi-tube bundles. @tbl-histogram-parameters should be interpreted as lower-limit estimates of the size and relative proportion of bundles, recalling that the distribution skewness indicates underestimation of the true bundle height.

Both the carbon nanotube bundle diameter mean and standard deviation are small for surfactant-deposited films when compared to the mean and standard deviation of solvent-deposited films. However, despite the presence of surfactant, it is apparent both from @fig-afm-morphology and @tbl-histogram-parameters that not all surfactant-dispersed carbon nanotubes are deposited individually. Bundling may occur during the process of deposition onto the substrate, which could disrupt the repulsive forces from the surfactant coating and allow attractive forces to temporarily dominate. It is possible that the bundling of surfactant-dispersed carbon nanotubes is a consequence of dynamics introduced by the coffee-ring effect [@Deegan1997; @VanGaalen2021]. The coffee-ring effect refers to a build-up of dispersed solid forming around the edges of a dispersion evaporating on a surface. This process occurs due to the dispersion edges being fixed by surface forces, leading to capillary flow outwards to replace liquid evaporating at the edges, bringing solid material along with it. The presence of vapour is known to disrupt this capillary effect [@Bishop2020], which may explain why mean bundle diameter is lower for the films deposited in surfactant with steam present relative to films deposited in surfactant without steam.

The discussion in this section gives us a new understanding of the histograms shown in @fig-afm-morphology. It is now apparent that these histograms are linear combinations of skewed normal distributions. These distributions include a negatively-skewed distribution corresponding to the substrate surface and a positively-skewed distribution corresponding to the carbon nanotube bundles. X and Y junctions between overlapping nanotubes may also form a similarly skewed normal distribution as part of the full histogram [@Murugathas2018]. The complete linear combination could be modelled mathematically in order to rapidly extract key parameters from atomic force microscope images [@Marchenko2010], but implementing this approach is outside of the scope of this thesis. Another outcome of this discussion is awareness that carbon nanotube bundling within a network is lowered by the presence of surfactant during deposition. Introducing steam when depositing with surfactant lowers bundling even further, but also leads to residual surfactant pooling and attaching to the substrate surface. These results may both be explained by the presence of steam enabling surfactant to follow carbon nanotubes to the substrate surface, which keeps them from bundling during the attachment process. The unwanted persistence of surfactant means that higher temperature vacuum annealing may be required for robust biosensors [@Kane2014].

### Raman Spectroscopy {#sec-pristine-raman}

(c) shows the spread of the D-peak/G$^+$-peak spectral ratios corresponding to each film.
:::

Raman spectroscopy was also used to analyse and compare the deposited carbon nanotube networks. Raman spectra were collected from a solvent-deposited carbon nanotube film and a steam-assisted surfactant-deposited film, both on silicon dioxide, in the manner described in @sec-raman-characterisation. These spectra were then processed using the Python script mentioned in @sec-raman-analysis. For each location, spectra over two wavenumber ranges were collected. A peak corresponding to the silicon dioxide substrate, found in the range between 100 cm$^{-1}$ and 650 cm$^{-1}$, was used as a reference peak for the normalisation of intensity across the wavenumber range between 1300 cm$^{-1}$ and 1650 cm$^{-1}$. These normalised spectra are shown in @fig-pristine-raman. In all spectra, a D-band comprising a single D-peak is observed at $\sim$ 1320 cm$^{-1}$, and a G-band comprising two G-peaks, G$^-$ and G$^+$, is observed between $\sim$ 1525 cm$^{-1}$ and $\sim$ 1650 cm$^{-1}$. These features are characteristic of networks of semiconducting carbon nanotubes [@Dresselhaus2005; @King2014]. 

Closer inspection of the D peak and G peaks can give us important information about network composition. G$^-$ is a minor peak found at $\sim$ 1570 cm$^{-1}$, while G$^+$ is a larger feature at $\sim$ 1590 cm$^{-1}$. The G$^+$ feature describes the in-plane vibration of carbon bonds along the length of the carbon nanotubes, while the G$^-$ feature describes the in-plane vibration of bonds about the nanotube circumference [@King2014; @Swiniarski2021]. The splitting between the wavenumber location of the G$^-$ and G$^+$ local maxima is lower in @fig-surfactant-deposited than in @fig-solvent-deposited, indicating more metallic nanotubes are present in the surfactant-deposited network [@Swiniarski2021]. The D-peak gives an indication of the defects present in the carbon nanotube atomic structure [@King2014; @Swiniarski2021]. The size of the normalised D-peak appears much lower in @fig-solvent-deposited than in @fig-surfactant-deposited, indicating the solvent deposition process introduces less defects to the carbon nanotubes than surfactant-mediated deposition. 

It is also possible to compare the relative magnitude of the D-peak and G$^+$-peak intensity to quantify carbon nanotube structural disorder, which disrupts in-plane lattice vibration [@Dresselhaus2005; @King2014]. @fig-dg-peak-comparison gives a summary of the ratios between the D-peak and G$^+$-peak across all nine positions for the solvent-deposited and surfactant-deposited film. It is immediately observed that I$_{D}$/I$_{G}$ is significantly larger for the steam-assisted, surfactant-deposited films than for the solvent-deposited films. This is a further indication of the presence of defects across the steam-deposited network. These defects are likely introduced through the introduction of charge impurites by surfactant aggregates present around the carbon nanotubes [@Christensen2022]. However, at the same time, the range of values for the I$_{D}$/I$_{G}$ ratio is lower for the steam-deposited network. This spatially homogeneous vibrational behaviour implies the steam-deposited network is more evenly distributed than the solvent-deposited network, which matches the discussion in @sec-pristine-morphology.

Devices with a 100 nm or 300 nm SiO$_2$ layer were used for liquid gated measurements, and devices with a 100 nm SiO$_2$ layer were used for backgated measurements. @fig-pristine-cnt-characteristics displays multi-channel measurements of representative devices fabricated as described in @sec-fabrication. To ensure a consistent comparison, each device here was encapsulated with AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 encapsulation before measurements were taken. The channels which did not exhibit reliable transistor characteristics are not shown. These 'non-working' channels were either shorted, due to metal remaining on the channel after lift-off, or were very low current, due to a very sparse carbon nanotube network.

####  Liquid-Gated CNTFETs {.unnumbered}

The liquid-gated devices in [@fig-solvent-tx-lg], [@fig-surf-tx-lg] and [@fig-steam-tx-lg] each exhibited ambipolar characteristics, commonly observed in liquid-gated carbon nanotube network FETs [@Kauffman2008; @Heller2009; @JongYu2009; @Derenskyi2014; @Murugathas2018; @Albarghouthi2022]. When devices were appropriately configured, leakage current (shown by the dashed traces) did not exceed $\sim 1 \times 10^{-7}$ V across the forward and reverse sweep. The devices shown which used steam-deposited carbon nanotube films showed the least hysteresis. @sec-pristine-AFM demonstrates that the mean diameter of the bundles in these films is about 0.9 nm less than the mean bundles in films deposited without steam present, and 5.5 nm less than those in films deposited in solvent. Hysteresis is known to scale roughly linearly with bundle diameter, due to trapped charge increasing as bundle density of states is increased [@Pop2009]. Steam-deposited devices also showed significantly less channel-to-channel variation in electrical characteristics more generally. Channel 1 in @fig-solvent-tx-lg has a much higher off-current than the other channels of the same device, which appears to be due to a uncommonly high proportion of metallic carbon nanotubes present in the network conduction pathways of this channel [@Rouhi2011; @Zaumseil2015]. 

A summary of key parameters of pristine liquid-gated devices is shown in @fig-sweep-parameters. The full dataset consists of three sets of 21 liquid-gated transfer characteristics of working channels, with each set corresponding to the use of a particular method of carbon nanotube network deposition in the device fabrication. Measurements from at least three devices are included in each set. Each entry in the summary corresponds to the average of the specific parameter in the forward and reverse sweep direction. When steam was used for surfactant deposition of films, the resulting devices showed highly consistent channel-to-channel electrical properties. Since the carbon nanotube films on these devices are relatively dense, as seen in @fig-steaming-network, the network should be well above the percolation threshold. As many carbon nanotube pathways connect across the channel in parallel, small variations in the network morphology have less of an impact on the overall channel behaviour [@Murugathas2018]. @fig-cnt-histogram and @tbl-histogram-parameters indicate that the range of bundle sizes is relatively low in the steam-deposited films used in these devices, meaning the electrical behaviour of dominant conduction pathways is more spatially consistent. The repeatable subthreshold regime behaviour between channels seen for steam-deposited devices is a desirable attribute for reliable real-time multiplexed biosensing [@Kauffman2008; @Heller2009; @Gao2010].

Channels from surfactant-deposited film devices usually showed a larger on-off ratio and subthreshold slope than those from solvent-deposited devices. Decreasing the ratio of gate-sensitive semiconducting carbon nanotubes to metallic nanotubes tends to decrease the on-off ratio [@LeMieux2008; @Rouhi2011; @Zaumseil2015; @Murugathas2018]. @sec-pristine-raman seems to indicate there are more metallic nanotubes present in the surfactant-deposited films than in the solvent-deposited films. However, percolating conduction pathways dominate device behaviour and nanotube pathways across the channel with a lower degree of bundling are less likely to contain metallic tubes [@Murugathas2018]. Therefore, the larger on-off ratio for surfactant-deposited film devices is likely a result of their reduced nanotube bundle size and reduced bundle size variation relative to other films, as discussed in @sec-pristine-morphology. The larger subthreshold slope is likely due to increased mobility from a denser nanotube network in surfactant-deposited films [@Rouhi2011], as seen in @fig-steaming-network. A larger on-off ratio and subthreshold slope results in a larger change in conductance in response to changes in the transfer characteristic curve. Therefore, the larger on-off ratio and subthreshold slope of steam-deposited devices is desirable for improved sensor performance [@Kauffman2008; @Heller2009; @Gao2010].

All channels characterised had a positive threshold voltage ($V_{th}$). The threshold voltage was largest and most consistent for steam-assisted surfactant-deposited films. The relatively high values of $V_{th}$ which correspond to channel measurements from steam-assisted surfactant-deposited devices indicates increased $p$-doping of the network relative to networks deposited via alternative processes [@Kang2005; @Heller2008; @Murugathas2018]. As seen from [@fig-steamed-surfactant]-f and @fig-dg-peak-comparison, the steam deposition process leads to the presence of significant, persistent surfactant aggregates. It has been previously established that residual surfactant can $p$-dope carbon nanotubes, alongside enhancing $p$-doping from adsorped oxygen and water [@Kane2014; @Nonoguchi2018; @Christensen2022]. The presence of residual surfactant may also explain the lowered subthreshold slope, and therefore mobility, of the steam-deposited devices relative to devices with films deposited in surfactant without steam. The analysis by Kane *et al.* shows that the thermal annealling at 150$^\circ$C used in this work to remove residual surfactant is likely inadequate for this purpose. Oxidation of devices and vacuum annealling at high temperatures (> 600^\circ$C) may be required for effective desorption o f the persistent surfactant [@Kane2014; @Barnett2018]. Devices using films made using the alternative two methods have the advantage of not requiring careful treatment to remove surfactant.

####  Back-Gated CNTFETs {.unnumbered}

When characterising devices using the vapour delivery system chip carrier, the setup arrangement meant all measurements were taken using a backgate. [@fig-solvent-tx-bg], [@fig-surf-tx-bg] and [@fig-steam-tx-bg] show that backgated devices exhibit *p*-type transistor behaviour. Gate current leakage was negligible, as shown by the dashed line staying close to zero across the sweep. Significant hysteresis was observed. The hysteresis can be explained by the presence of defects or charge traps within and on the surface of the silicon dioxide and at interfaces between the silicon dioxide and carbon nanotubes [@Lee2007; @Lee2012; @Ha2014]. The hysteresis observed was much greater than for the corresponding liquid-gated sweeps on the right. The devices fabricated with a solvent-based deposition were switched off at a lower voltage than the devices which used surfactant during deposition.

Backgated transfer sweeps were taken of an single unencapsulated device with a 300 nm SiO$_2$ layer and steam assisted surfactant-deposited carbon nanotube network channels before and after being covered in $50 \mu$L 1XPBS electrolyte.
:::

Transfer measurements were taken to determine whether backgated measurements could be taken of an unencapsulated device in the vapour sensor chamber with 1XPBS covering the channels. @fig-buffer-effect-on-backgate shows the behaviour of an unencapsulated backgated device with a 300 nm SiO$_2$ layer before and after being covered by 50 $\mu$L of 1XPBS (phosphate buffered saline). The on-off ratio and hysteresis of the channels increase significantly. The presence of water increases hysteresis through introducing charge traps at the silicon dioxide surface around the carbon nanotubes and at the surface of the nanotubes themselves [@Kim2003; @Lee2007; @Franklin2012; @Ha2014]. There is also a significant increase in current leakage to the backgate for larger applied voltages, despite the electrolyte having no visible physical contact with the silicon backgate or copper plane. This leakage current may simply be due to an increase in relative humidity around the device due to the presence of water [@Conseil2014]. As any variation in threshold voltage due to hysteresis and significant leakage current are undesirable for sensing procedures, this configuration was not used for vapour sensing purposes.

The characteristics of working device channels upon initial exposure to 1XPBS are shown in (a) and (b). The transfer characteristics of channel 1 in (a) and channel 5 in (b) after various degrees of exposure to 1XPBS are shown in (c) and (d) respectively, with each transfer sweep numbered in the order the sweeps were taken. The dashed lines correspond to measurements of gate leakage current.
:::

Graphene field-effect transistor devices were electrically characterised in the manner described in @sec-electrical-characterisation and analysed using the Python code discussed in @sec-field-effect-transistor-analysis. 

@fig-pristine-graphene shows the liquid-gated transfer characteristics of two graphene devices. These devices were fabricated prior to Jun 2021. Both devices exhibit the ambipolar characteristics typical of liquid-gated graphene devices [@Heller2009a;@Heller2010; @Xia2010; @Kireev2017]. As with the carbon nanotube network devices, leakage current remained below $\sim$ 1 $\times$ $10^{-7}$ V across both the forward and reverse sweep. Hysteresis between the forward and reverse sweep is caused by trapping of charge within and on the surface of the SiO$_{2}$ dielectric [@Bartolomeo2011]. The major Dirac point for these devices is slightly to the right of V$_{\textrm{Dirac}} \approxeq$ 0 V, which indicates $p$-doping of the channel. This slight $p$-doping is likely a result of a adsorption of oxygen and water from the air and residue resist from photolithography [@Cheng2011; @Shin2012; @Kireev2017].

Some devices exhibited a double-minima feature, indicating the presence of two Dirac points. This effect arises due to doping of graphene by the metal contacts. In shorter length channels, metal doping affects the entire channel length, leading to a consistent Fermi level and a single Dirac point. However, for longer channel lengths like ours, the doping effect from metal contact no longer reaches the entire channel, leading to a difference in Fermi level between the graphene in the channel and graphene under the metal contact. The difference in Fermi levels results in the presence of a second Dirac point [@Bartolomeo2011; @Feng2014; @Peng2018]. The global minimum of the transfer characteristic can be referred to as the 'major' Dirac point.

@fig-pristine-graphene also shows the effect of 1XPBS on the graphene channels. The channels were measured on exposure to 1XPBS, after exposure to 1XPBS for one hour, and after the device surface was rinsed and 1XPBS was replaced in the well one time, two times and three times successively. A slight negative shift of the major Dirac point was observed. This effect is possibly a result of gate bias stress, where successive transfer sweeps introduce charge traps to the graphene layer and alters the current level at a given gate voltage [@Bargaoui2018; @Noyce2019]. Alternatively,  Kireev *et al.* found that a series of liquid-gated sweeps also reduced the size of the second Dirac point, and suggested that it indicated the gate current was removing atmospheric contaminants from the graphene surface via current annealing [@Kireev2017]. This could be explained as the removal of contaminants causing improved contact between the metal and graphene surface, and thus increasing metal doping and consistency of the Fermi level across the channel. If the contaminants removed are $p$-dopants, then this effect could also explain the negative shift of the major Dirac point.

To verify the sensitivity of the fabricated field-effect transistors and therefore verify their suitability for sensing, control measurements replicating a typical sensing experiment were taken before functionalising the device channels. This involved first ensuring the device showed no response to 1XPBS, a sequence referred to here as the 'PBS control series'. The PDMS well contained 80 $\mu$L 1X PBS at 0 s. The PBS control series ran over the first 1800 s, with 20$\mu$L phosphate buffer saline (1XPBS) additions at 100 s, 200 s and 300 s, and 20$\mu$L subtractions at 400 s, 500 s and 600 s. The device was left untouched over the next 1200 s to allow the current level to settle. The gate voltage was held at $V_g$ = 0 V.

@fig-transfer-sweeps shows the transfer sweeps of the six working channels of a steam-assisted surfactant-deposited carbon nanotube field-effect transistor encapsulated with AZ$^\circledR$ 1518, fabricated in Mar 2023 and measured using the PXIe. The central 'negative current' feature in the transfer characteristics of channels 1 and 7 is due to unphysical measurements which come from equipment error and can be treated as zero current passing through the channel. The threshold voltages of the channels are shown in @tbl-threshold-voltages. @tbl-threshold-voltages also shows the difference between the threshold voltage of each channel and the mean threshold voltage of the device. The mean threshold voltage was $V_{th}$ = $150 \pm 20$ mV. As discussed previously, the electrical characteristics are highly consistent between the channels due to the film deposition method used.

The transfer characteristics in (a) were taken of the steam-deposited carbon nanotube field-effect transistor used here for an example of salt concentration sensing. The absolute values of measurements are shown, so that negative values resulting from measurement error can be visualised. Linear fits to the PBS control series from each channel from 1200 s onwards are shown in (b), while exponential fits to the PBS control series from $0-1200$ with the linear fit subtracted are shown in (c). No significant response to PBS additions are seen at any of the addition times from 100 s - 600 s.
:::

@fig-linear-fit shows the PBS control series corresponding to each device channel alongside gate current. In both series, there is no clear stepwise response to any addition or subtraction of 1XPBS. Gate leakage current remains negligible across the entire control series, with no change in response to 1XPBS additions. The current has a period of faster decay followed by slower baseline drift, similar to observations by Lin *et al.* and more recently Noyce *et al.* for parallel arrangements of single carbon nanotubes in air or vacuum [@Lin2006; @Noyce2019]. This effect results from changes in the occupancy of charge traps in and around the substrate and carbon nanotubes. The magnitude of baseline drift is lower for our devices than for those characterised by Noyce *et al.*, which may be a result of numerous device and setup differences which affect the presence of charge traps. These differences include liquid-gating instead of back-gated, the use of a network of carbon nanotubes instead of single nanotubes, a different channel length, the use of a 300 nm instead of 90 nm SiO$_2$ layer, and the use of an asymmetric, liquid-gated transfer sweep over a shorter voltage range to characterise devices before each control series was measured [@Noyce2019].

As a first approximation to the longer time constant exponentials discussed by Noyce *et al.* [@Noyce2019], linear fits were performed on each PBS control series from $1200-1800$ s. These linear fits are shown by the dashed yellow lines in @fig-linear-fit. The parameters from each fit in @fig-linear-fit are shown in @tbl-linear-fits, where $I = mt + b$. The fits for channels 1, 5 and 7 are all in parallel within error. The gradient value for each fit in @fig-linear-fit is reasonably consistent between all channels, all falling within a 2.6 pA/s range. When the long-term linear fits were subtracted from the raw data, the remaining dataset followed a exponential decay trend for both control series. @fig-exp-fit shows exponential fits to the remaining curve from $0-1200$ s, which was successful for all channels except channel 5. The parameters from each fit are shown in @tbl-exp-fits, where $I = a\exp(-t/\tau)$. The exponential fits had characteristic time constants ranging between $300 - 800$ s, indicating that 1800 s is a sufficient length of time for this short-term baseline drift to completely decay to zero. The exponential term for channel 1 is close to linear, indicating the channel has low net trapped charge. It is unclear why the behaviour of this channel is signficantly different from the others.

From this analysis it appears that the baseline drift for the liquid-gated carbon nanotube devices can be accurately approximated as a combination of a exponential and linear term. The lack of response to 1XPBS at any of the six PBS addition and removal times gives us confidence that this is a stable baseline which can be used for reliable chemical sensing. Furthermore, after $\sim 800$ s the baseline drift can be reasonably approximated as linear, with a small gradient of less than -10 pA/s. The slow change of current means that it becomes easier to distinguish responses due to analyte addition. It can therefore be concluded that the 1800 s length of the PBS control series is appropriate for minimising baseline drift for more reliable sensing.

### Sensing Series {#sec-salt-conc-series}

A salt concentration sensing series were performed from 1800 s onwards, directly after the PBS control series. The responses to successive dilutions of the liquid-gate electrolyte were recorded to confirm the fabricated devices were sensitive to small environmental changes in their pristine state, to check for spurious signals, and to ensure gate current leakage or other confounding factors were not contributing to sensing responses. The PDMS well contained 80 $\mu$L 1X PBS at 1800 s. During the series, successive additions of deionised water were made to reduce the concentration of PBS in the well. An initial 1X PBS addition was performed at 2100s, to confirm no changes occurred during the PBS control series that would interfere with sensing. All additions to the well in the sensing series and resulting changes to the PBS concentration in the well are shown in @tbl-salt-conc-series.

Various visualisations of a multiplexed salt concentration sensing series taken from a single device. The source-drain voltage $V_{ds}$ was 100 mV, and gate voltage $V_g$ was 0 V.

The signal data in (d) is shown in box plot format in (e) alongside a fit to the median change in signal for each addition. The R squared value for the fit was 0.86.
:::

@fig-salt-conc-no-norm shows a multiplexed salt concentration sensing series from the channels of a single AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 encapsulated device, measured with the NI-PXIe. The gate voltage used was 0 V, which meant current measurements were well above the magnitude of the subthreshold device current. Gate current measurements did not exceed 1 nA for the SU8 encapsulated devices, and did not exceed 10 nA for the AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 devices. At each of the deionised water addition times, the current traces for at least two out of six channels showed a sharp, transient increase in current followed by a return to an increased baseline. It is well established that changing the salt concentration of the liquid gate has an electrostatic gating effect on the carbon nanotubes or graphene, and changes the transfer characteristics of the channel. This shift in transfer characteristic leads to a real-time signal response to each addition [@Heller2009; @Heller2010; @Kireev2017].

Using the data in @tbl-linear-fits, the linear term approximating baseline drift ($mt$) for each channel can be subtracted from the data in @fig-salt-conc-no-norm to account for the downward drift. The mean current level just before 1800 s then becomes roughly constant. Next, each channel is normalised relative to their initial mean current level $I_{0}$. Artifacts resulting from PXIe-2737 module lag, single datapoints which fall well below the current level of the immediately preceding and succeeding datapoints, are also removed. This 'despike' process uses an interquartile range filter, which is described in @sec-field-effect-transistor-analysis. The resulting dataset is shown in @fig-salt-conc-detrend. This figure shows that the signal-to-noise ratio remains roughly similar across all channels of the device. However, the behaviour of the initial transient increase with each addition is highly variable across channels and between additions for a single channel.

As measurement of the highly variable initial transient is not useful for robust sensing purposes, a moving median filter was applied, with the implementation of this filter discussed in @sec-field-effect-transistor-analysis. The filtered data is shown in @fig-salt-conc-detrend-filter. Noise and initial transients are removed completely, while the clearly defined step to a new current baseline is retained. Using the realtime data in @fig-salt-conc-detrend-filter, a plot of signal against addition can be created using the method described in @sec-field-effect-transistor-analysis, shown in @fig-salt-conc-signal. This presentation of the data allows us to see the increase at each step relative to $I_{0}$. 

Intriguingly, even though the largest change in PBS concentration occurred at the first deionised water addition (see @tbl-salt-conc-series), there was very little signal change across all channels, while a relatively large change occurred at the second addition. The logarithm of final salt concentration has previously been shown to be proportional to conductance change in the linear on-regime [@Heller2010]. @fig-salt-conc-box-plot shows the signal change presented in terms of this logarithmic relationship. The median values of the first two additions do not line up well with the overall logarithmic trend; insufficient mixing in the tightly enclosed PDMS well environment for the first few additions may be responsible for this result. Subsequent additions may improve mixing in the well, leading to the change in concentration at the surface of the channel being more representative of the overall concentration in the well.

The processed data shown in @fig-salt-conc-detrend and @fig-salt-conc-detrend-filter is normalised to $I_{0}$, but an alternative normalisation can more effectively filter out remaining drift present. This normalisation presents data relative to both $I_{0}$ and the final current reading $I_{f}$ using the formula $(I - I_{0})/(I_{f} - I_{0})$. Using this normalisation, the data in @fig-salt-conc-detrend and @fig-salt-conc-detrend-filter can be displayed instead as (a) and (b) respectively. (c) shows a magnified version of the step at addition 2 in (a).
:::

In @fig-salt-conc-detrend and @fig-salt-conc-detrend-filter, from around the second deionised water addition onwards, the drift behaviours of individual channels begin to significantly diverge. This deviation from the baseline drift subtracted from the raw data occurs either because the linear fit is only a first-order approximation which weakens with time, or because the additions themselves affect the drift behaviour. Displaying the data as discrete signal changes, as in @fig-salt-conc-signal, is one way of excluding these deviations (see @sec-field-effect-transistor-analysis). An alternative way of presenting the signal changes, by normalising relative to both $I_{0}$ and the final current reading with the formula $(I - I_{0})/(I_{f} - I_{0})$, is shown in @fig-salt-conc-sensing-2. This approach is useful for filtering out remaining unaccounted-for drift behaviour in order to compare the short-term transient responses to additions across the device channels. Furthermore, it lets us better understand how the short-term transient responses affect the longer-term step responses discussed earlier.  

@fig-salt-conc-detrend-2 and @fig-salt-conc-detrend-filter-single-step show that the transient responses to DI water additions vary significantly across the surface of the device. For example, @fig-salt-conc-detrend-filter-single-step shows that in response to the second DI water addition, channel 7 gives a large initial transient response about twice the size of the step increase between 2600 and 2800 s. Meanwhile, channels 1 and 2 show no transient response above the step increase. @fig-salt-conc-detrend-filter-single-step indicates transient size is based on location across the device, with neighbouring channels showing the most similar behaviour. This spatially-dependent behaviour may indicate transient responses are determined by the location of the channel relative to either the location of water additions or the slightly-variable location of the liquid gate. Larger and longer-lasting transient responses are not entirely removed by the moving median filter, as shown by comparing @fig-salt-conc-detrend-2 to @fig-salt-conc-detrend-filter, and so careful placement of additions is important when sensing to minimise this effect. However, even the longest-lasting transients appear to decay to zero within about 200 s, demonstrating that a 200 s spacing between additions at minimum is necessary for reliable real-time liquid-gated sensing using this setup.

The transfer characteristics of a single steam-deposited carbon nanotube field-effect transistor channel are shown in (a). V$_{gap}$ is the gate voltage corresponding to the center of the transistor bandgap, found at the minimum of the characteristic curve. The signal-to-noise ratio of the channel response to a deionised water addition after a suitable control series is shown in (b). The blue current trace in (b) was performed gating the device 150 mV away from V$_{gap}$, while the red current was performed gating the device 200 mV away from V$_{gap}$.
:::

To understand the effect of gate voltages on signal-to-noise ratio, two PBS control and salt concentration sensing series were performed with the same channel at different gate voltages. The transfer characteristics of this channel are shown in @fig-transfer-sweep-2, with coloured dashed lines marking the voltages used for gating the transistor during each sesning series. @fig-salt-conc-SNR shows the initial PBS and DI water additions made after 1800 s. Previous work on the signal-to-noise ratio for liquid-gated, encapsulated carbon nanotube devices suggests that gating devices close to $V_{gap}$ should give the largest signal-to-noise ratio for salt concentration additions [@Heller2009]. However, this was not what was observed for our carbon nanotube field-effect transitor, as @fig-salt-conc-SNR shows improved signal-to-noise ratio, i.e. the signal step can be more clearly distinguished, when gated at a voltage further removed from $V_{gap}$. This discrepancy could be a result of the use of a network of carbon nanotubes rather than a single nanotube; gating may have less of an impact on noise when a network morphology is used. Alternatively, it could be a result of a lack of mixing in our static well setup leading to inconsistent signal sizes with concentration change. Heller *et al.* used a flow cell during their signal-to-ratio work [@Heller2009]. By using a flow cell with our devices, it would be possible to confirm whether this is the case, and this might also help us reduce the size of unwanted transient responses resulting from drop-wise additions.   

## Conclusion

To ensure fabricated transistors were suitable for biosensing purposes, the morphology and electrical properties of the pristine carbon nanotube and graphene transistors were investigated. 

The morphology of the carbon nanotube networks were found to have a significant impact on the electrical characteristics of the devices, which was determined through comparison of the skew-normal height profile of the carbon nanotube network and the key electrical parameters of a range of carbon nanotube devices. When networks were highly bundled ($>90$ %), there was a large range of carbon nanotube bundle diameters present in the network. This large variation in the size of conducting pathways resulted in a wide range of on-off ratios and threshold voltages for the liquid-gated devices created using these carbon nanotube films. In contrast, devices using films fabricated with a relatively low percentage of bundling ($<75$ %) showed highly consistent on-off ratios and threshold voltages, along with low hysteresis, due to the relatively consistent bundle diameters and high density of these networks. These low-bundling networks were found to have a mean bundle distribution height of $3.3 \pm 1.0$ nm. When performing multiplexed sensing, consistent channel behaviour is highly desirable since comparing sensing behaviour between channels is more straightforward.

However, atomic force microscope imaging and Raman spectroscopy also indicated that less bundled networks had the most surface contamination present. Aggregated surfactant present on the surface had a height of more than 4 nm, and introduced significant defects to the carbon nanotube network.  The introduction of $p$-dopants to the carbon nanotubes by surfactant appears to have significantly increased the threshold voltage of steam-assisted surfactant-deposited network devices relative to steam-free surfactant-deposited network devices. Since the presence of surfactant could negatively impact biosensing, techniques to remove contaminants should be explored in more detail. Oxidation and thermal annealing of carbon nanotube films at high temperatures could be used to resolve this issue, and this is discussed further in @sec-future-work. The presence of electrolyte on the surface of a backgated transistor for use in vapour sensing was also found to significantly adversely affect its electrical characteristics.

Constant voltage real-time measurements of the carbon nanotube field-effect transistor devices had a characteristic drift that could be modelled using a exponential and linear term. The linear term of baseline drift had a reasonably consistent gradient between device channels, with a mean value of $-6.1 \pm 1.2$, indicating that similar drift behaviour should be reproducible between devices fabricated in the same manner. The time constant of the exponential term ranged from $\tau = 330 \pm 20$ s to $\tau = 800 \pm 750$ for the device characterised. These results indicate that the PBS control series is  asuitable time length for minimising the effects of baseline drift on sensing, since the range of time constants are all well below the total timescale of the control series.

Salt concentration or PBS dilution sensing series indicated that the carbon nanotube transistor devices were highly sensitive to environmental changes and therefore suitable for sensing work. Successive additions of deionised water to the 1XPBS present in the well gave signal responses of up to 2.5 % above the control response. The signal response was found to be proportional to the logarithm of concentration, giving a fit to the median response sizes with an $R^2 = 0.86$. Deviations from this trend can possibly be explained by the enclosed sensing environment preventing sufficient mixing of electrolyte concentrations within the PDMS well, which could possibly be addressed by using a flow cell for sensing work. It was also seen that the signal size relative to baseline drift was highly consistent between channels. This is a promising result when it comes to ensuring consistent multiplexing, but it cannot be guaranteed that this behaviour carries over to sensing with biofunctionalised devices.

Graphene field-effect transistor devices were often found to possess a double-minima feature, which appears to be the result of a lack of doping from the metal contacts in the center of the device channels. These double Dirac points are unlikely to have an significant effect on the sensing behaviour of graphene devices. The graphene device characteristics were found to be consistent after 1 hour exposure to 1X PBS with minimal drift, with an on-off ratio of 5 and major Dirac point voltage of 0.3 V. There was some indications from the transfer characteristics that $p$-dopants were present on the graphene surface. Salt concentration sensing with graphene FETs is not shown in this thesis, but it is important to perform this experiment and use similar analysis techniques if there are any concerns about the sensitivity of a fabricated batch of graphene devices.
