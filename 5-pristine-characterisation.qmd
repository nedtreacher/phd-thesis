##	Carbon Nanotube Network Morphology

@fig-afm-morphology shows a side-by-side comparison of the surface morphology of carbon nanotube films fabricated using the methods described in @sec-dep-carbon-nanotubes. These images were collected using an atomic force microscope and processed in the manner described in @sec-afm-characterisation. They each show bundles of carbon nanotubes with a range of diameters and lengths, with each bundle containing one or multiple nanotubes. As discussed in previous works using solvent-based deposition techniques for depositing carbon nanotubes, multi-tube bundles form due to mutual attraction between nanotubes [@Zheng2017; @Thanihaichelvan2018; @Thanihaichelvan2019]. The diameter range provided by the supplier for the individual carbon nanotubes used is 1.2-1.7 nm, while the length range is 0.3-5.0 $\mu$m (Nanointegris). Figures @fig-steaming-network-90 and @fig-steaming-network-99 also show the presence of some non-nanotube contaminants on the substrate surface, which could be tiny amounts of residual photoresist. The presence of residual photoresist is discussed further in @sec-photoresist-contamination.

The distribution of the deposited carbon nanotubes was modelled to quantatively understand the effect of the various methods used on the resulting network morphology. The diameter range of deposited single-walled carbon nanotubes can be modelled via a normal or Gaussian distribution [@Thanihaichelvan2018; @Liu2013; @Vobornik2023]. However, when we extract and bin the height profiles from the 2.5 \mum x 2.5 \mum AFM images in @fig-afm-morphology, the histograms do not follow a normal distribution. The AFM histogram shape results from the SiO$_2$ substrate and carbon nanotubes both exhibiting some roughness, which is partially due to surface contamination by atmospheric contaminants. In the case of the surfactant-deposited networks, residual surfactant may also contribute to surface roughness [@Vobornik2023]. However, it has been shown that bare SiO$_2$ substrate has a surface roughness which can also be modelled with a normal distribution. This normal distribution has a spread of approximately \pm1 nm about the mean, which can be set as the reference or zero point for other height measurements [@Velicky2015]. As both the carbon nanotube and silicon dioxide background heights can each be modelled using a normal distribution, we assume that a linear combination of normal distributions can be used to model the AFM histograms in @fig-afm-morphology.

Surface profile histograms extracted from the 2.5 \mum x 2.5 \mum atomic force microscope images seen in @fig-afm-morphology, each fitted with a linear combination of normal distributions. The component normal distributions corresponding to each linear combination are also shown.
:::

By using the analysis discussed in @sec-histogram-analysis, we find that a linear combination of normal distribution fits to all histograms corresponding to the AFM images in @fig-afm-morphology with an R-squared value of at least 0.987. The first or left-most distribution for all figures in @fig-afm-histograms corresponds to the SiO$_2$ substrate roughness, centered at \approx 0 nm and with a standard deviation of 0.3-1.1 nm. For the carbon nanotube film deposited with solvent, the second distribution then corresponds to bundles of carbon nanotubes. If we model bundles as cylinders and we assume nanotubes have a diameter of 1.5 nm and follow 2D packing, as proposed in [@Thanihaichelvan2018], we can state the mean bundle size in terms of number of nanotubes *n*.
