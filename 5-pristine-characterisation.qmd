#	Characteristics of Pristine Carbon Nanotube & Graphene Field Effect Transistors

##	Carbon Nanotube Network Morphology

@fig-afm-morphology shows a side-by-side comparison of the surface morphology of carbon nanotube films fabricated using the methods described in @sec-dep-carbon-nanotubes. These images were collected using an atomic force microscope and processed in the manner described in @sec-afm-characterisation. They each show bundles of carbon nanotubes with a range of diameters and lengths, with each bundle containing one or multiple nanotubes. As discussed in previous works using solvent-based deposition techniques for depositing carbon nanotubes, multi-tube bundles form due to strong mutual attraction between nanotubes [@Zheng2017; @Thanihaichelvan2018; @Thanihaichelvan2019; @Nguyen2021]. However, when surfactants are present, they adsorb onto the carbon nanotubes and form a highly repulsive structure able to overcome the strong attraction between nanotubes. This repulsion then keeps the individual carbon nanotubes isolated [@Wenseleers2004; @Shimizu2013]. The diameter range provided by the supplier for the individual carbon nanotubes used is $1.2-1.7$ nm, while the length range is $0.3-5.0$ $\mu$m (Nanointegris).

The diameter range of deposited single-walled carbon nanotubes can be modelled via a normal or Gaussian distribution [@Thanihaichelvan2018; @Liu2013; @Vobornik2023]. However, when we extract and bin the height profiles from the 2.5 $\mu$m $\times$ 2.5 $\mu$m AFM images, plotted in black in @fig-afm-morphology, the histograms do not follow a normal distribution. The reason for this result is that the carbon nanotubes do not lie perfectly level on a perfectly level silicon oxide substrate - the atomic force microscope histogram would only be a single normal distribution in this ideal case. In practice, the SiO$_2$ substrate and carbon nanotube surface both have a degree of roughness, which may in part be due to the presence of atmospheric contaminants. In the case of the surfactant-deposited networks, residual surfactant may also contribute to surface roughness. Nanotubes can also undergo significant compression from the AFM tip in tapping mode [@Vobornik2023]. Furthermore, nanotubes overlap and cross over each other, creating junctions with the combined height of the overlapping nanotubes.

It has been demonstrated that the surface roughness of a bare SiO$_2$ substrate can also be modelled with a normal distribution. This normal distribution can be set as the reference or zero point for other height measurements [@Velicky2015]. As both the carbon nanotube and silicon dioxide background heights can each be modelled using a normal distribution, we make an initial assumption that a linear combination of normal distributions can be used to model the AFM histograms in @fig-afm-morphology. Using the process discussed in @sec-histogram-analysis, we approximate the normal distributions corresponding to the silicon oxide substrate and carbon nanotube network, shown in @fig-afm-morphology as green and red curves respectively. The silicon oxide peak appears to fit more closely to the distribution with smaller carbon nanotube heights, which could be due to measurement of the silicon background being improved when feature height is smaller. We notice that the distribution for the carbon nanotube bundles decays to approximately zero before reaching 0 nm, which is physically appropriate.

By subtracting the modelled silicon and carbon nanotube normal distributions from the AFM histogram, we find a remaining 

The first or left-most distribution for all three figures in @fig-afm-histograms corresponds to the SiO$_2$ substrate roughness, centered at $\sim$ 0 nm and with a standard deviation of $0.4-1.2$ nm. For the carbon nanotube film deposited with solvent, the second distribution then corresponds to bundles of carbon nanotubes. If we model bundles as cylinders, and we assume the component nanotubes follow 2D packing and are of equal diameter, we can give an estimate the mean bundle size in terms of number of nanotubes *n* [@Graham1998; @Thanihaichelvan2018; @Specht2023].

@tbl-circle-packing shows the relationship between the diameter of a bundle and the constituent diameters of up to nine 2D packed carbon nanotubes within that bundle. The second distribution in @fig-bundled-network-histogram indicates the mean diameter of carbon nanotube bundles is 4.62 nm. Assuming an average carbon nanotube diameter of 1.45 nm, we find a $d$/$d_n$ packing ratio of 3.19, indicating an average bundle composition of $\sim$ 7 nanotubes in @fig-bundled-network-histogram. 

For the carbon nanotube networks deposited using surfactant in @fig-afm-histograms, we notice that there are two non-SiO$_2$ distributions present. The mean of the second distribution, the left-most non-SiO$_2$ distribution, falls below the average height for a single carbon nanotube. This attribute indicates that the distribution either represents broken pieces of individual carbon nanotubes, residual surfactant or other atmospheric contamination resistant to acetone and isopropanol rinsing. This contamination distribution is significantly larger for the carbon nanotube devices which used steam in the deposition process. The presence of this contamination histogram distribution was consistently found for all sampled surfactant-deposited film AFM data, while not present for any of the sampled solvent-deposited films.

From @fig-steaming-network, we also see that steam deposited devices have sparsely distributed $\sim$ 10 nm high features visible on their surface which are not present for the other films. These observations may be evidence of trapped water microdroplets on the surface from the steam, or could be from the steam causing surfactant to form persistent features on the surface. The size of this central peak may be useful for determining the extent of contamination in a carbon nanotube film, discussed further in @sec-contamination. Such contamination may or may not have implications for biosensing suitability, but surfactant contamination could certainly have negative effects on biological elements sensitive to surfactant.

The distribution means corresponding to each type of deposition method, averaged across histogram fits from three 2.5 $\mu$m $\times$ 2.5 $\mu$m atomic force microscope images, are given in @tbl-histogram-parameters. The carbon nanotube bundle mean is given alongside the number of carbon nanotubes corresponding to the mean height according to 2D packing as given in @tbl-circle-packing and Thanihaichelvan *et al.* [@Thanihaichelvan2018]. 

It is noticeable that the location of silicon and contamination distribution means are highly consistent between films. Also notable is a the large decrease in bundle size when surfactant is used in the deposition process. There is also a large standard deviation in mean bundle size seen for solvent deposited devices, corresponding to a wide range of bundle sizes present on the atomic force microscope images of the solvent-deposited films. 

It is also important to consider that for all figures in  @fig-afm-morphology, larger height measurements in the carbon nanotube distribution include surface contamination on the carbon nanotubes as well as bundle-bundle junctions. The distribution may also encompass broken nanotube pieces and some silicon oxide surface contamination at the low end of the range. When considering the proportion of single-tube bundles relative to multi-tube bundles, we exclude heights from the carbon nanotube normal distribution below 1.2 nm, the minimum height of the supplied carbon nanotubes. We also exclude heights above double the distribution mean, to ignore bundle-bundle junctions and surface contamination. 

We then compare the proportion of the curve below and above 2.9 nm, the minimum multi-tube bundle size for 1.45 nm diameter nanotubes. By doing so, we get a rough estimate of the proportion of single- to multi-tube bundles present on the surface. We can also compare the total area of the carbon nanotube distribution to the area of the other distributions to get an estimate of the surface coverage by bundles. These values, averaged across the histogram fits from three 2.5 $\mu$m $\times$ 2.5 $\mu$m atomic force microscope images, are given in @tbl-histogram-parameters. However, the mean values for surfactant-deposited films are in line with those previously found for IsoNanotubes-S deposited on silicon oxide using alternative analysis methods [@Vobornik2023].

In @fig-afm-morphology and @tbl-histogram-parameters, we see that carbon nanotubes deposited in a surfactant dispersion form bundles which are significantly less wide than the bundles in the film deposited using solvent. However, we also see that despite the presence of surfactant, not all surfactant-dispersed carbon nanotubes are deposited individually. Bundling may occur during the process of deposition onto the substrate, which could disrupt the repulsive forces from the surfactant coating and allow attractive forces to temporarily dominate. The 

It is possible that the bundling of surfactant-dispersed carbon nanotubes occurs due to the coffee-ring effect [@Deegan1997; @VanGaalen2021]. The coffee-ring effect refers to a build-up of dispersed solid forming around the edges of a dispersion evaporating on a surface. This process occurs due to the dispersion edges being fixed by surface forces, leading to capillary flow outwards to replace liquid evaporating at the edges, bringing solid material along with it. The presence of vapour is known to disrupt this effect [@Bishop2020]. @tbl-histogram-parameters demonstrates that on average, the presence of steam reduces the number of nanotube bundles present and increases surface coverage, supporting the above hypothesis.

##	Electrical Characteristics {#sec-pristine-electrical-characterisation}

### Carbon Nanotubes

Each carbon nanotube device fabricated was electrically characterised as described in @sec-electrical-characterisation. Figure @fig-pristine-cnt-characteristics displays multi-channel measurements of representative devices fabricated as described in @sec-fabrication. To ensure a consistent comparison, each device here was encapsulated with AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 encapsulation before measurements were taken. The channels which did not exhibit reliable transistor characteristics are not shown. These non-working channels were either short, due to metal remaining on the channel after lift-off, or were very low current, due to a very sparse carbon nanotube network. Devices shown here with a solvent-deposited carbon nanotube network were fabricated prior to Jan 2022; devices with a surfactant-deposited network without steam present were fabricated prior to Jun 2021; devices with a surfactant-deposited network without steam were fabricated prior to Sep 2022.

Consistent subthreshold regime behaviour between channels is desirable for reliable multiplexed biosensing.
