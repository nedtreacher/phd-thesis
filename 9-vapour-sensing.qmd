# Vapour-Phase Sensing with iOR-Functionalised Carbon Nanotube Devices {#sec-vapour-biosensing-iORs}

## Introduction

The next step in the process was to integrate these components into a biosensor for testing in the redesigned vapour delivery system, as described in @sec-vapour-sensing-biosensors. In the vapour delivery system, signal responses can be compared to those measured by the non-selective onboard reference sensors. However, it was important to first ensure the functionalised devices worked consistently as biosensors in the existing aqueous sensing setup, as described in @sec-pristine-characteristics.

The second approach, which eliminates both surface coatings and the nanodisc format, was therefore tested in the vapour delivery system. However, little response was shown by the functionalised sensor to the positive analyte. Finally, possible reasons for this lack of response are discussed.

## Sensor Responses to Vapour Flow {#sec-responses-to-vapour}

![Simplified schematic showing the flow into and out of the device chamber and manifold of the delivery system. The input flows from the carrier and dilution line are represented by C and D, and the output flow through the PID is represented by P. The exhaust can either flow past the relative humidity indicator or straight to the fumehood. This diagram assumes that flow through leaks in the chamber and manifold is low enough to be considered negligible, which was confirmed by leak testing with bubble solution.](figures/ch9/chamber-manifold-v2.png){#fig-chamber-schematic width="100%"}

Once the rate of flow through the device chamber had been calibrated, the correct operation of the reference sensors used in the system was verified. Various flow rates in and out of the chamber were used to calibrate and verify the reference sensors. These flows in and out of the chamber are labelled on the simplified schematic in @fig-chamber-schematic. Note that the labels on this schematic assume that nitrogen compression at any point within this schematic is negligible. @sec-calibration shows that a 200 sccm flow into the chamber corresponds to an actual rate for C + D of $\sim$ 230 sccm. If a 150 sccm flow rate as measured by the flowmeter is pumped out through the PID, @sec-calibration shows that P $\sim$ 110 sccm. This means that $\sim$ 50% of the flow through the chamber exits via the PID. If a 100 sccm flowmeter rate is pumped through the PID, P $\sim$ 70 sccm, and therefore $\sim$ 30% of the chamber flow exits through the PID.

### Relative Humidity Indicator

To test the relative humidity indicator (RHI), all valves out of the chamber were sealed except for the valve for the relative humidity indicator chamber. This meant all flow coming out of the system would pass through the relative humidity indicator chamber (P = 0 sccm and exhaust goes to RHI in @fig-chamber-schematic). Continuous nitrogen flow was then placed through the chamber until relative humidity dropped to about 20%. 10 mL of deionised water was placed into the analyte bottle. A series of different flow rates through each line was sent to the chamber, with the sequence of flow rates shown in @tbl-RHI-flow-sequence (t = time, C = carrier line flow rate, D = dilution line flow rate). Note that between 200 s and 600 s, the total flow rate remains the same, but the ratio of dilution to carrier flow differs.

| t (s) | C (sccm) | D (sccm) |
|-------|----------|----------|
| 200   | 0        | 400      |
| 200   | 100      | 300      |
| 200   | 200      | 200      |
| 200   | 200      | 100      |
| 200   | 200      | 0        |

![Relative humidity readouts from the relative humidity indicator juxtaposed with flow rates from the dilution line and carrier lines of the vapour system, with 10 mL deionised water in the carrier line analyte bottle.](figures/ch9/RHI_verification.png){#fig-RHI-verification width="65%"}

@fig-RHI-verification shows that the Telaire sensor records decreased humidity after flow exclusively from the dilution line and increased humidity after flow from the analyte bottle. It also shows that in regular 200 s intervals, the rate of relative humidity change increases and then begins to stabilise. Each accelerated change in relative humidity occurs about 50 s after a corresponding increase in flow through the carrier line. It appears a 50 s period passes before an increased concentration of water vapour due to increased carrier flow first reaches the relative humidity indicator. Over the full 800 s of carrier line flow, relative humidity increases from a minimum of $14.0\pm2.0$% to a maximum of $43.6\pm2.0$%. The temperature in the chamber remained between 21.0\pm0.5°C and 22.0\pm0.5°C over the entire measurement period. Combining equations @eq-absolute-humidity and @eq-water-vapour-pressure from @sec-reference-sensors, we find that the absolute humidity in the chamber reaches a low of $2.6\pm0.4$ gm$^{-3}$ at 238.1 s, 38.1 s after the initial onset of carrier flow, and a high of $8.4\pm0.5$ gm$^{-3}$ at 998.8 s, after 798.8 s of carrier flow through the chamber. The clear response of the Telaire RHI to increased water vapour flow confirms that this sensor is working.

### Photoionisation Detector with Continuous Vapour Flow

To test the photoionisation detector, the device chamber and carrier line were first purged of vapour through the exhaust using a roughing pump, with the PID valve closed to protect it from the pump. The PID valve was then opened, the micropump was set to 150 sccm as read by the flowmeter. During testing with the PID, the total flow into the chamber was set at 200 sccm as read by the Tylan mass flow controllers. The calibration curves in @sec-calibration show that the actual flow C + D was then therefore approximately the same as the actual flow rate into the PID, P. A flow of 200 sccm nitrogen was placed through the dilution line to the chamber for 10 minutes until successive concentration readings from the PID were either approximately constant, or until baseline drift was small enough to be considered negligible. These measurements were then used as the baseline (0 ppm) for subsequent measurements. 5 mL of the volatile organic compound ethyl hexanoate (EtHex), also known as ethyl caproate, was placed into the analyte bottle. A flow of 150 sccm was then sent through the carrier line and 50 sccm through the dilution line for 600 s. The same procedure was performed on two separate dates spaced three days apart (23 Feb and 26 Feb) to check that the measured PID response to ethyl hexanoate vapour pumped out of the manifold was repeatable.

::: {#fig-PID-EtHex-response layout="[[-11,3,-1,70,-15], [-11,3,-1,70,-15]]"}

![](figures/(b).png)

![](figures/ch9/240223_240226_comparison.png)

The response of the photoionisation detector to ethyl hexanoate vapour over 600 s of exposure is shown relative to the 200 sccm nitrogen flow baseline in (a), and normalised with respect to the maximum reading in (b).
:::

The responses from each date are shown in @fig-PID-EtHex-response. In @fig-PID-EtHex-response (a), the response corresponding to each measurement date is shown unnormalised, with the parts per million concentration shown relative to the nitrogen baseline as recorded by the PID. Both measurements show little to no response to vapour for approximately 50 s, which seems to be the time taken for vapour to first reach the PID. Over the next 100s, there is a rapid increase in vapour concentration detected, which then settles to a constant concentration at about 300 s. This appears to be the maximum concentration of EtHex vapour that can be contained by the chamber in this configuration. There is approximately a 200 parts per billion difference in maximum concentration between the measurement on each date.

However, this is not unexpected. As discussed in @sec-reference-sensors, the PID is being run uncalibrated, and some drift of the sensitivity of the sensor due to environmental changes is highly likely. To check that the PID records the same evolution of vapour flow with time, regardless of its sensitivity, the measurements from both dates were then normalised with respect to the maximum concentration reading. @fig-PID-EtHex-response (b) shows that once normalised, the rate of change in concentration with time is almost identical between the two measurement sets. This test verifies that the evolution of vapour concentration of the device chamber can be repeatably measured using the PID in the vapour delivery system.

### Photoionisation Detector with Vapour Flow Intervals

A further series of tests were performed to verify whether it was possible to compare different concentrations of vapour in the chamber using the PID. All testing was performed on the same day to minimise sensitivity drift. For each test, the system was purged of vapour and the total dilution flow into the chamber was set at 200 sccm as read by the Tylan mass flow controller. Flow out of the chamber to the PID was set at 100 sccm as read by the micropump flowmeter, and the almost-constant nitrogen baseline after 10 minutes was set as the PID zero point. 5 mL of the volatile organic compound ethyl hexanoate (EtHex) was placed into the analyte bottle. During each test, 200 sccm was continuously flowed through the dilution line, except during three evenly spaced intervals of equal length. During these intervals, 150 sccm flow was placed through the carrier line and 50 sccm flow placed through the dilution line. In each test, the input interval time was varied to examine its effect on maximum vapour concentration recorded by the PID. As it took longer for the PID to return to a constant baseline with increased input intervals, when the input interval was increased, the spacing between intervals was also increased.

Input intervals were either 50 s, 100 s or 200 s in length. During each input interval, 150 sccm carrier flow and 50 sccm dilution flow were placed through the chamber.](figures/ch9/input_time_comparison.png){#fig-concentration-comparison width="70%"}

The results of three tests, with input intervals of 50 s, 100 s and 200 s, are shown in @fig-concentration-comparison. Each interval of carrier flow corresponds to a rapid increase in concentration, which reaches a peak, then decreases. The maximum concentration reached for each interval is shown above the corresponding peak. Note that the maximum concentration label does not correspond to the difference between the original baseline and the maximum concentration of each peak. Instead, it corresponds to the difference between the concentration measurement at a set time before the onset of carrier flow and the maximum concentration reached. For each test, this set time is 5% of the spacing time used, 50 s, 150 s and 300 s respectively. This approach was taken to account for what appears to be drift from the original 0 ppm baseline. This variable baseline drift was particularly significant for the 100 s interval measurements, where concentration measurements settled to a new baseline of $\sim$ 0.05 ppm after the third peak.

The values of the three concentration maxima in each test shown in @fig-concentration-comparison are highly consistent, with only a $\pm$ 0.02 ppm margin of error. This experiment demonstrates that if tests using the PID are performed during the same day, placing the same vapour flow into the PID for the same interval of time in each test, it is possible to measure the same maximum concentration with the PID. It furthermore indicates that placing the same amount of vapour flow into the chamber for a set amount of time leads to a reproducible concentration of vapour building up within the chamber. Drift in the baseline does not significantly affect the magnitude of each concentration peak when measured relative to the baseline reading directly before each interval.

## Vapour Sensing with Volatile Organic Compounds {#sec-pristine-EtHex}

### Baseline Drift {#sec-vapour-drift}

When sensing vapour in the vapour delivery system, devices have no liquid gate, and are instead backgated when taking measurements. Therefore, the baseline drift of devices characterised in this manner should be considered separately to those characterised in an liquid-gated environment. Device baseline drift of a backgated device in the vapour sensing chamber is therefore examined here in more detail. A AZ$^\circledR$ 1518 encapsulated carbon nanotube network device was used for this discussion. The device was fabricated on a substrate with a 300 nm SiO$_2$ layer, and the carbon nanotube film was deposited using the steam-assisted surfactant method. Before measurements were taken, the vapour system was purged of vapour, the total dilution flow into the chamber was set at 200 sccm as read by the Tylan mass flow controller and flow to the PID was set to 150 sccm on the flowmeter. Sensing measurements were taken using the B1500A semiconductor device analyser.

The source-drain and gate current measured for a backgated device channel across 3600 s, where $V_{ds}$ = 100 mV and $V_g$ = 0 V is shown in (a). A linear fit to the data from 2400 s onwards has been indicated on (a) with a black dashed line. The linear fit has then been subtracted from (a) to give the dataset shown in (b). An exponential fit to the dataset in (b) is also shown in black.
:::

@fig-bg-baseline-drift (a) shows 3600 s of baseline drift from the same channel when the device was backgated at $V_g$ = 0 V and a source-drain voltage of $V_{ds}$ = 100 mV was placed across the channel. During this period of time, a 200 sccm nitrogen flow was placed through the device chamber with the dilution mass flow controller. Gate leakage current remains negligible across the entire control series. As seen for the liquid-gated device in @sec-baseline-drift, there is a period of rapidly-disappearing exponential decay followed by a period of stable, approximately linear baseline drift. The baseline drift observed here appears to be significantly lower than that seen by Noyce *et al.*. This observation suggests that the higher magnitude of drift observed by Noyce *et al.* is not primarily due to backgating in air, but instead results from the use of a significantly different fabrication process for their devices [@Noyce2019].

A linear least-squares fit was performed on the samples taken between 2400 s $-$ 3600 s, and the fit obtained had an R-squared value of 0.998. The constants obtained for the linear fit, where $I = c_1t + c_2$, were $c_1 = -17.31\pm0.05$ pAs$^{-1}$ and $c_2 = 0.779$ µA. Both linear and constant terms are higher than that of the average liquid-gated device drift. The linear fit was then subtracted from the raw data, and an exponential least-squares fit was performed on the remaining dataset. @fig-bg-baseline-drift (b) shows the exponential fit to this remaining dataset from 0 s $-$ 3600 s. The constants obtained for the exponential fit $I = I_0exp(-t/\tau)$ were $I_0 = 7.20 \pm 0.05$ nA and $\tau = 730 \pm 10$ s. The exponential term is similar in size to those found for the channels of the liquid-gated device, which may indicate the magnitude of this decay behaviour is independent of the type of transistor gating. Three time constants equates to $2190 \pm 30$, indicating the length of the control sequence could be safely reduced to 2400 s without the short-term exponential drift being present during sensing.

This analysis indicates that the baseline drift for the backgated carbon nanotube under nitrogen flow can be approximated as a combination of a exponential, linear and constant term. Furthermore, while only measured here for a single channel, it appears likely that we can expect backgated baseline drift behaviour to be similar to the multiplexed liquid-gated drifts observed in @sec-baseline-drift, except possibly with a longer time constant for the exponential term. It seems that the baseline drift behaviour in these devices is primarily due to the general nature of the carbon nanotube network. It appears possible that the type of gating used for device characterisation may affect the rate at which the exponential term decays. However, further experimentation may be needed to confirm this relationship, which is outside the scope of this thesis.

### Sensing Series {#sec-vapour-series}

Directly after the 3600 s control series, sensing devices were exposed to four intervals of volatile organic vapour flow from the carrier line. Two high vapour pressure compounds, ethyl hexanoate (0.21 kPa at room temperature [@EtHex]) and *trans*-2-hexen-1-al (0.88 kPa at room temperature [@E2Hex]), were measured separately using two different devices. 5 mL of the analyte of interest was placed into the analyte bottle on the carrier line before each sensing series. The same settings for the vapour delivery system were kept from @sec-vapour-drift. A total flow of 200 sccm between the two mass flow controllers was kept through the chamber at all times. During each interval 150 sccm flow was placed through the carrier line. Apart for the duration of these intervals, flow through the carrier line was kept at zero. The intervals were of varying lengths to see how the carbon nanotube device responded to various concentrations of vapour in the chamber as recorded by the PID. A 1200 s recovery period was placed between each carrier flow interval, where 200 sccm flow was placed into the chamber from the dilution line. A separate series was also performed for each device in an identical manner except without analyte in the analyte bottle. The chamber temperature was 22°C $\pm$ 3°C for all measurements.

Device channel responses to intervals of flow from the carrier line into the vapour delivery system chamber. Intervals begin at 3600 s, 4850 s, 6150 s and 7500 s. The length of each interval is indicated above the corresponding normalised current response to *trans*-2-hexen-1-al (E2Hex) in (a) and to ethyl hexanoate (EtHex) in (b). Each series is shown alongside a control series in which no analyte was present in the analyte bottle. The dataset after applying a moving median filter is shown in (c) for E2Hex and (d) for EtHex. The signal changes corresponding to the current responses to each interval are shown in (e) for E2Hex and (f) for EtHex.
:::

The results of these interval tests, both with and without analyte, are shown in @fig-EtHex-sampling (a) for *trans*-2-hexen-1-al and @fig-EtHex-sampling (b) for ethyl hexanoate. These results have been normalised, despiked and have had baseline drift corrections applied in the manner described in both @sec-python-analysis and @sec-salt-conc-series. To more clearly discern sensing behaviour through the noise present, a moving median filter was applied to these datasets, as shown in @fig-EtHex-sampling (c) and @fig-EtHex-sampling (d) for E2Hex and EtHex respectively. Most intervals of exposure to carrier line flow correspond to a current increase. These increases have been labelled with the length of the corresponding interval used. When analyte was present in the analyte bottle on the carrier line, the response to each exposure interval was generally larger than the response when no analyte is present. Some response to carrier line flow is observed even when the analyte bottle is empty. As the system lines are purged with a roughing pump before sensing, and both lines are checked for vapour before sensing during the PID, it appears these small responses may be due to a slow leak of volatiles from the fumehood environment into the carrier line when not in use.

Vapour concentration measurements from PID, shown in @fig-EtHex-sampling-PID, also indicate that an ionisable gas is reaching the chamber during each interval, even when the analyte bottle is left empty. As discussed in @sec-responses-to-vapour, some baseline drift is seen after each addition, which is particularly significant for the second two carrier line intervals in @fig-EtHex-sampling-PID (a). The baseline immediately before each peak was therefore subtracted from the maximum concentration measured during each interval to give the values shown above each peak. These values are taken to represent the nominal change in chamber concentration as a result of each exposure interval.

:::

Each signal response corresponds to a change in conductance through the exposed carbon nanotubes within the device channel. These conductance changes occur due to the molecular adsorption of analyte vapour onto the external and internal surfaces of the nanotubes. The vapour can dope the semiconducting carbon nanotubes in the channel, causing a shift in the channel threshold voltage, and can cause carrier scattering when adsorped onto the metallic nanotubes present. Binding of analyte to a gas sensing material can be reversible or irreversible. In general, adsorption onto carbon nanotube sensors is irreversible. This irreversibility means after a response to analyte, readings from the sensor will not return to the original baseline within the same timescale as the sensing response, even after stopping analyte flow to the chamber [@Agnihotri2005; @Lee2005]. From @fig-EtHex-sampling, it is clear that the carbon nanotube sensor configuration used here is primarily irreversible, where the current level does not return to baseline within a period of 1200 s after analyte exposure.

![Device response against maximum concentration measurement corresponding to each interval of carrier flow, where control responses to carrier line flow from an empty analyte bottle have been subtracted. The chamber temperature was 22°C ± 2°C during collection of all data used here.](figures/ch6/EtHex-ratio-comparison.png){#fig-EtHex-ratio-comparison width="55%"}

Assuming that the signal response is directly proportional to the degree of surface coverage by adsorbed analyte on the carbon nanotube network [@Lee2005], the relationship between signal response (@fig-EtHex-sampling) and concentration in the device chamber (@fig-EtHex-sampling-PID) can be modelled with a adsorption isotherm [@Agnihotri2005]. The Freundlich adsorption isotherm (@eq-freundlich) models adsorption onto a heterogeneous surface, and has previously been used to model adsorption of volatile organic molecules onto single-walled carbon nanotubes.

$$
q_e = K_F(k_Dk_{RF}C_e)^{1/n}
$$ {#eq-freundlich}

$K_F$ is the adsorption capacity and $1/n$ is adsorption intensity. $1/n$ can be used to understand the heterogeneity of adsorbate sites [@Ayawei2017; @Sabzehmeidani2021]. The vapour response factor, which is equal to 1.6 for a 10.6 eV photoionisation detector (PID), is denoted as $k_{RF}$. As the PID has been run uncalibrated, a factor $k_{D}$ has been included to account for linear span drift. As span drift due to window contamination can cause concentration readings to be reduced up to 30% after six months of PID operation, it is expected that $k_{D}$ falls within the range of 0.2 $-$ 1 for the sensing configuration used [@PIDmanual; @Ionscience].

To examine only the device response directly attributable to the presence of analyte vapour, the average response resulting from carrier line exposure with no analyte present was subtracted from each device current reading. The same was then done for the vapour concentration readings from the PID. Due to the equivalence of the three final concentration measurements in @fig-EtHex-sampling-PID (a), $0.11\pm0.01$ ppm, no isotherm could be fitted to the E2Hex dataset. An average response above control of $0.74\pm0.18$% was found for these E2Hex intervals, where the high error margin resulted from the relatively high level of noise in the collected data. A best-fit Freundlich isotherm to EtHex concentration readings against device channel responses is shown in @fig-EtHex-ratio-comparison. The data collected does not contradict the possibility that it follows a Freudlich isotherm. This dataset is limited, collected primarily to demonstrate the responsiveness of carbon nanotubes to vapour. Further investigation into this relationship was outside of the scope of this thesis, but further work could be done to more rigorously confirm whether the Freundlich isotherm is a valid model for relating the PID response to the pristine carbon nanotube sensor response of this system.

Source-drain voltage was $V_{ds}$ = 100 mV for each of the forward and reverse sweep. The change in characteristics from avi-tagged OR35a functionalisation is shown in (a), while the change resulting from a 5 W plasma clean is shown in (b).
:::

Despite the drawbacks outlined previously, the functionalisation method in this section was also used to trial vapour phase sensing for the odorant receptor devices. The vapour pressure of methyl salicylate, 5 Pa, was too low for reliable vapour system delivery (*c.f.* @sec-vapour-series) [@MeSal]. The odorant receptor OR35a (batch number AviHis-OR35a-001, prepared 12 months earlier) was therefore used in the functionalisation process instead of OR10a, as it responds to *trans*-2-hexanal (E2Hex) [@Murugathas2019a], which can be delivered successfully in the vapour system (see @sec-vapour-series). Back-gated transfer characteristics of a OR35a-functionalised before and after functionalisation are shown in @fig-OR35a-TX-comparison (a), alongside characteristics from a device before and after plasma cleaning at 5 W without subsequent functionalisation in @fig-OR35a-TX-comparison (b). As expected, a significant drop in mobility is seen as a result of the plasma cleaning step. Unlike the functionalised device, the device plasma cleaned without functionalisation turns off entirely at $V_g \sim$ 3 V, with this difference possibly due to variability in the results of plasma etching for different carbon nanotube devices.

The baseline drift data across the first 2500 s of measurement for both a pristine and OR35a-functionalised device is shown in (a). A linear fit to the baseline drift data between $2150-3350$ s is indicated in (a) with a black dashed line. The difference between the raw dataset and linear fit is shown in (b), with an exponential fit to the data indicated with a black dotted line.

Intervals begin at 3350 s, 4450 s and 5600 s.
:::

In a similar manner as in @sec-pristine-EtHex, the functionalised device was back-gated in the vapour delivery system and a series of exposures to E2Hex was performed. Another pristine device channel was measured during the same sensing series for a baseline comparison. Before each series was performed, the vapour system was purged of vapour, the total dilution flow was set at 200 sccm (nominal) and flow to the PID was set to 150 sccm on the flowmeter. In line with the discussion in @sec-vapour-drift, a 2500 s control series was used. The baseline drift is shown in @fig-E2Hex-sampling (a) and (b), with a backgate of $V_g$ = 0 V and a source-drain voltage of $V_{ds}$ = 100 mV across the channel during each measurement. During this period, 200 sccm of nitrogen flow was placed through the device chamber. A linear fit $I = c_1t + c_2$ was performed on the the measurements from each channel between $2150-3350$ s. For the pristine device, $c_1 = -1.29\pm0.01$ pAs$^{-1}$, while for the OR35a-functionalised device, $c_1 = -0.55\pm0.01$ pAs$^{-1}$. @fig-E2Hex-sampling (b) shows the exponential fit $I = I_0\textrm{exp}(-t/\tau)$ to each dataset with linear drift subtracted, where the time constant for the pristine device was $\tau = 963 \pm 25$ s and for the OR35a-functionalised device was $\tau = 704 \pm 4$ s.

After the 2500 s control series, each device was exposed to three intervals of *trans*-2-hexen-1-al vapour flow from the carrier line in the same manner. A total of 5 mL of the analyte of interest was present in the analyte bottle before each sensing series. A total flow of 200 sccm was kept through the chamber at all times. During each interval, 150 sccm of this total flow passed through the carrier line. Except during intervals, no flow was placed through the carrier line. A 1000 s recovery period was used between each interval. The temperature was 20°C $\pm$ 2°C during each series. These sensing series, which have been normalised, despiked, corrected for drift and filtered, are shown side-by-side in @fig-E2Hex-sampling (c). A larger current change is shown by the functionalised device than the pristine device after each addition. The PID indicated a similar concentration of E2Hex was present in the device chamber with each addition, shown in @fig-E2Hex-additions-PID. Note that measurements were taken two days apart; the \$\sim\$50% variation in chamber concentration reached with each interval is largely due to PID span drift (@sec-responses-to-vapour).

The current responses from the functionalised carbon nanotube sensor are not the sharp, clear responses to analyte of the liquid-gated device seen in @sec-MeSal-aqueous-sensing. There are alternative explanations for the current changes observed in @fig-E2Hex-sampling which do not involve specific detection of analyte. The functionalisation may have altered the drift behaviour so that the linear approximation used here for removing baseline drift is no longer useful. It may be useful for future works to incorporate computational approaches to baseline drift compensation if the linear approximation regularly breaks down for functionalised devices [@Zhang2022]. The breakdown in this approximation has then led to current increases that do not directly correspond to analyte being added. The functionalisation process may also have caused the device to become more sensitive to changes in vapour concentration, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio of the sensor. Regardless of their origin, the current increases observed cannot fairly be described as clear or convincing sensing responses. A working sensor should exhibit responses more similar to those seen in @sec-MeSal-aqueous-sensing.

It may be necessary to ensure the sensing environment is similar to that used for aqueous sensing to be give reliable results. A buffered environment helps to stabilise the unprotected odorant receptors [@Sato2014], and so a PDMS well containing 50 µL 0.5% v/v DMSO $1 \times$ PBS was attached to the device for vapour sensing. Despite the well being upside-down in the vapour delivery system, the hydrophobicity of the PDMS was sufficient to store the PBS securely. Current sampling over a 1 hour period in this configuration, with 200 sccm constant flow across the surface of the well, is presented in @fig-buffer-vapour. If the well solution was leaking out of the well, the conductive liquid could form a short between the channel electrodes and backgate, prompting a large increase in gate current. However, gate current remains stable across the entire measurement period, indicating the well remains secure. Conversely, fluctuations in drain current became apparent after $\sim$ 800 s, and at $\sim$ 2400 s, the direction of baseline drift was reversed entirely. These undesirable changes appear to result from rapid evaporation of liquid in the well; when the device chamber was opened, only $\sim$ 10-20 µL of PBS was still present.

For readibly reproducible vapour sensing, therefore, one of two approaches present themselves. The first approach is to identify a covalent attachment mechanism that allows for specific attachment to odorant receptors via a histidine or avidin tag. This approach allows for a protective format like nanodiscs to be used in the sensing setup while eliminating concerns around unwanted attachment of the protective membrane protein. The weak nature of non-covalent binding lends itself to variable functionalisation quality and poor reproducibility. Non-covalent functionalisation may also be less suitable for use in non-aqueous environments lacking buffer solution stabilisation [@Li2023]. Conversely, covalent functionalisation of mammalian-OR sensors has been used before for successful vapour sensing of eugenol [@Goldsmith2011]. Alternatively, a similar process to the one investigated here could be used. This non-covalent approach would require the development of a highly reproducible cleaning process, able to remove a variety of organic contaminants from the carbon nanotube surface prior to functionalisation. Furthermore, a liquid capture layer which is both biofriendly and has a low vapour pressure may need to be identified and used. Ideally, this liquid would be hydrophilic and miscible with a wide range of substances. Further discussion of potential capture layers can be found in @sec-future-work-vapour.

## Conclusion

Both a PBS dilution sensing series and vapour sensing with *trans*-2-hexen-1-al and ethyl hexanoate were used to verify that the carbon nanotube transistor devices were highly sensitive to changes in both aqueous and vapour environments. The expected logarithmic signal response behaviour was observed when detecting dilutions of PBS in a liquid-gate environment. Signal size relative to baseline drift was highly consistent between channels, which is promising for multiplexing work. Deviations from the logarithmic trend possibly indicated insufficient mixing within the PDMS well during sensing, which may be addressed in future aqueous sensing work by using a flow cell. When vapour phase sensing, transducers were found to be sensitive to parts-per-million vapour concentrations as measured by the photoionisation detector. These experiments are useful controls for the biofunctionalised devices. As these devices are highly sensitive, it is important to be able to discern whether a signal response is due to modification of an attached biomolecule or whether the carbon nanotubes themselves are responding.

This aqueous functionalisation approach was also used for vapour sensing with OR35a odorant receptors. Clear responses consistent with those seen in an aqueous environment were not observed. The changes in current seen appear more likely to result from a breakdown of the linear approximation of baseline drift for functionalised devices, or from increased non-specific sensitivity of the device post-functionalisation. It was concluded that reproducible vapour sensing would require either a robust covalent functionalisation method which used a protective membrane-like format, or alternatively requires a capture layer to protect non-covalently attached odorant receptors from the harsh chamber environment. However, it was found 0.5% v/v DMSO $1 \times$ PBS could not act as this capture layer, due to rapid evaporation of the layer dramatically altering baseline drift from $\sim$ 800 s onwards. An alternative liquid should therefore be identified which is biofriendly and miscible, while having a low vapour pressure (ideally $< 100$ Pa at room temperature). It should also repel PDMS, to remain contained in the PDMS well upside down in the device chamber. These approaches significantly expand the scope of this work, and are therefore not addressed extensively in this thesis. However, some preliminary work on alternative approaches is discussed in @sec-future-work.
